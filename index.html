          Well. The 'big piece' of the project is done. I bought a raspberry pi, an SD card, and used one of the sites
          above to get a RetroPi image up and running. It sure is a nostalgia trip. Seeing all these old games that I
          used to spend hours and hours on. Along with the fact that incredible classics are available at my fingertips
          now. I'm pretty excited about it.
          The process is easy: Get the Pi, flash your image, I'm on Mac so I used <a
            href="https://www.balena.io/etcher/"></a>Etcher</a> to do that. Put it in, turn it on. Plug in your
          controller. Boom. Ready to rock.
          The real big question for me now is do I want to take it that step further? Do I want to hook up a joypad and
          buttons? Do I want to build a full arcade cabinet?
          I think maybe part of the beauty of it is that it can just sit on my desk now. However the woodworking aspects
          of making the cabinet would certainly test my skills everywhere.

        <h3>Premise:</h3>
        I will be building an application that scans ISBN codes, generates the
        titles of books scanned.
        <p>
          This is gonna be a sensitive topic. I want to build something
          interesting, and I'll have a head start using Skeleton Key. I'll use
          it as the base for this. The first piece I want is to be able to scan
          a barcode from an image, and return the ISBN. Then we need to look up
          the ISBN, and find the title. There's some other small bit's that
          we'll explore like how to send a server's traffic through VPN. Let's
          get started. I was tempted to call this project "Too much power for
          one man".
        </p>
        <p>We'll start by cloning our Skeleton Key Framework:</p>
        <code>git clone http://www.github.com/JakeCasey/skeleton-key-backend.git
        </code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>git clone http://www.github.com/JakeCasey/skeleton-key-frontend.git
        </code>
        <br />
        <br />
        <code>git clone http://www.github.com/JakeCasey/skeleton-key-prisma.git
        </code>
        <p>
          So we have a directory that has our whole application framework inside
          of it. All three pieces are separately deployed to our production
          servers and allow our application to function! The cool part is that
          with these three pieces I already have a fully functioning app!
        </p>
        <p>
          So something crazy happened just now. There's been a little time lapse here, so when I began working on BOK, I
          noticed that how the backend server was set up, it took a while. I had to run npm i, prisma init, copy files
          and overwrite files, and overall it would probably take like 45 minutes just to get everything where it needed
          to be.
          That's dumb. I hate dumb things. Especially if I plan on building a lot of software with Skeleton Key in the
          future, I needed to do that process faster. I want to be able to start on the meat of a project immediately.
          So I built a little bootstrapper!
          Simple: it runs npm i, prisma init, moves your new DB details from the prisma file created, and then
          overwrites it with how we have Skeleton Key set up.
          It's not terribly complicated, but all in all, you can set up your backend super quick fast.

          Neat, huh?

          I think so at least. After that short detour, we're ready to get rocking on our actual application!
          One thing I'm thinking of right now is I'm not 100% sure how to interface with the Postgres database that's
          running on my Dokku servers. I always get distracted! I'll have to make sure to come back to this.
          I wonder if I can automatically push local DB dumps to my Dokku server and vice versa... I'll have to look
          into this.
          Ok ok ok, no more DB shit.
          First I have to build something that either lets me take a picture of a barcode, or takes a photo upload of a
          barcode.
          Then I need to build a backend that searches another site, and filter and present those results to the user,
          and then the user can select a result, and the server takes care of the rest. I'm being deliberately vague for
          . . . reasons.
          Let's get started.
        </p>
        <p>
          Haha fuck. I built the whole thing without documenting any of it. Haha I suck. Ok. The overview:
          <li>I used <a href="https://serratus.github.io/quaggaJS/">Quagga.js</a></li>
          <li>A Google API for fetching data.</li>
          <li>Cheerio.js for scraping the pages provided by the fetched data.</li>
          <li>And some other stuff.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
          The original name for this app was Too Much Power For One Man. Instead of focusing on this application I want
          to draw a little attention to the time I saved with Skeleton Key.
          It worked almost exactly how I planned. Which is nuts.
          Maybe I'll release a little bit more about this project in the future, but for now it's gonna have to stay
          like this.
          There's also going to be a big ol' section about deploying this bad boy, too. Probably. Maybe. Whatever.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>5/24/19</strong> Wow. What a ride. I actually finished this a long time ago but let this table of contents document die. It's got a lot of shit on it and I'm really not sure if I want to revive it or not, but I better at least mention what ended up happening here. Sometime I ended up setting up <a href="http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/">Dokku</a>, a PaaS for your own server. Why? Because heroku is fucking expensive and that bothers me. 
          Plus I hate myself, I don't know. There's just something enticing about whiling away my extremely limited time here on earth hunched maliciously over a keyboard alit only by a blinking terminal cursor. Anyway, I may have mentioned that an integral part of this application is that some of it's traffic needs to run over VPN. This is where most of my aforementioned hunching took place. Dokku does a lot of your routing and stuff for you, for example allowing you to host apps on subdomains based on the project name. Very useful for lots of small projects w/ standard routing and obvious connections. Frontend talks to backend talks to database talks to backend talks to frontend. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. Except when you introduce a VPN all that shit just gets tossed out the window and you're left mired in IP tables that you don't really fully understand trying to route connections through the VPN but some of the connections back to the frontend. Poring over esoteric RFC's and man files for linux tools that you've only heard about before but never really found a time to use. Modern web development is so abstracted from a command line that I've never had to read an IPtable before or actually route packets internally on a linux computer.
          So after about what I would guess to be 80 hours of random bullshitery, I finally gave up and bought a new linode. Had that sucker up and running in about 15 minutes. Kill me.

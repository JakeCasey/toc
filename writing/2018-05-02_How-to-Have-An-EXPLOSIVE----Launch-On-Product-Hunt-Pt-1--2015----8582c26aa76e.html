If you haven’t read that one, it’s actually an awesome guide on how to launch on PH. Go do it now.</p><p name="69a6" id="69a6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My goal in this article is to go through the best launches of 2015 and isolate reasons why some launches did better than others. If there’s interest, in the future I’ll do the same with 2016 and 2017 as well.</p><p name="a841" id="a841" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What I want to know is “Why were these better than others”? The internet changes at a rapid pace. Who knows if the information we get from this study will be useful. However, I’m sure there’ll be trends that distinguish themselves over time. There has to be some overarching patterns in PH launches that we can dig up, and use in our own launches. In the week I’m planning on launching <a href="http://www.deva.io" data-href="http://www.deva.io" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Deva</a> and I’d like to use this information to my own benefit to make the launch go as awesomely as possible. Let’s dive in.</p><p name="7c1f" id="7c1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll try to keep this as simple as possible, and with each product try to follow a general template. I chose these categories simply as distinct pieces of the launch on PH.</p><ul class="postList"><li name="0519" id="0519" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Description</li><li name="303a" id="303a" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Icon/Images</li><li name="87a6" id="87a6" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Tagline</li><li name="8648" id="8648" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Maker Comment</li><li name="f443" id="f443" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Notable Differences</li><li name="5141" id="5141" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Conclusion</li></ul><h3 name="712a" id="712a" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">Product #1 Startup Stash</h3><h4 name="59a0" id="59a0" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Description</h4><p name="5634" id="5634" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Startup Stash is our first product. #1 in 2015, over three years ago, with 15048 upvotes and 201 comments. It’s in the “Productivity” category.</p><p name="1ecd" id="1ecd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">On the initial glance, it looks like Startup Stash is still truckin’. It’s a curated list of directories and resources to help people build startups. This little bit of info is going to be very important later. I’ll explain in a bit, but let’s keep moving along.</p><h4 name="5faf" id="5faf" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Icon/Images</h4><figure name="0c3d" id="0c3d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 104px; max-height: 107px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 102.89999999999999%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LYe7SJGlHKICvW80xmXxxw.png" data-width="104" data-height="107" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LYe7SJGlHKICvW80xmXxxw.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Startup Stash Logo</figcaption></figure><p name="f66f" id="f66f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">The image for Startup Stash is a screenshot of the page itself. Which looks like it hasn’t changed since launch. Later on down the line we’re going to see a lot more gif and logo usage as opposed to a screenshot of the site. I guess it’s worth mentioning that the orange in the image matches the PH logo? But I can’t imagine that having any notable effect on the launch.</p><h4 name="c930" id="c930" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tagline</h4><blockquote name="b9ea" id="b9ea" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">A curated directory of 400 resources &amp; tools for startups</blockquote><p name="799f" id="799f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">A feature of PH is the tagline limit: under 60 characters. Believe me, I’ve been trying to write a tagline for Deva for the last week or so. 60 characters is a lot less than you think it is. The cool thing about this tagline is it only says what the product is. No fluff. No beating around the bush, no buzzwords. It’s matter-of-fact and straight to the point.</p><h4 name="d6db" id="d6db" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Maker Comment</h4><figure name="27de" id="27de" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 683px; max-height: 538px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 78.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eRwpz3cTFlCyYftskc_-_A.png" data-width="683" data-height="538" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eRwpz3cTFlCyYftskc_-_A.png"></div></figure><p name="3e08" id="3e08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Note that the first sentence of his maker comment is almost identical to his tagline, with slightly more description. It includes the categories available on the site, and a teaser of the types of tools you can find there. The tone of the comment is pretty conversational. The guy is telling you what he built. It doesn’t feel sleezy or have any ‘ulterior motive’, and there’s a lot to be said for being genuine and honest in your interactions with the public. You’re there to help them, not trick them. There’s a gif in there too, not sure if that could have any effect.</p><h4 name="dfc7" id="dfc7" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Notable Differences</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="3157" id="3157" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Startup Stash has nearly double the amount of upvotes as the #2 product launch.</li><li name="e7d8" id="e7d8" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Hunter/Maker are the same, though it’s established that who hunts the product doesn’t matter.</li><li name="5cb4" id="5cb4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">It’s a product *for* Startup founders.</li><li name="2bfa" id="2bfa" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Free</li></ul><h4 name="4773" id="4773" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion</h4><p name="4c36" id="4c36" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Right off the bat, this is a product that appeals directly to PH users. Like myself, a lot of PH users are makers themselves. They’re interested in things that help them build their businesses.</p><p name="118c" id="118c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Second, the tone is pretty simple. Here’s a bunch of stuff that can help you build your startup. Nothing fancy. That probably plays into it’s popularity.</p><h3 name="7658" id="7658" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product #2 Pexels 2.0</h3><h4 name="46db" id="46db" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Description</h4><p name="de5a" id="de5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">#2 in 2015 is Pexels 2.0 with 7569 upvotes and 78 comments. It’s in the “Tech” category.</p><p name="ac21" id="ac21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Pexels is a stock photography website. The quality is pretty awesome. When I’m looking for stock photography I hate running into the cheesy terrible stock photography. Thankfully, after finding Unsplash and now Pexels, it looks like I’ll never have to deal with it.</p><h4 name="13b1" id="13b1" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Icon/Images</h4><figure name="e149" id="e149" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 95px; max-height: 92px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 96.8%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*dyBgHPzG3-2uOg3gJ3I7Hg.png" data-width="95" data-height="92" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*dyBgHPzG3-2uOg3gJ3I7Hg.png"></div></figure><p name="1717" id="1717" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Pexel’s PH icon is in the same vein as Startup Stash. It’s a screenshot of the actual site as it was in 2015. The site appears to have changed. After doing a cursory look around, there’s still some pretty high quality stock photos available. The other images in the launch page don’t seem to be anything special, only pictures of the site. Perhaps that’s beneficial in itself? Let the product speak for itself instead of trying to dress it up as something it’s not?</p><h4 name="406e" id="406e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tagline</h4><blockquote name="8e30" id="8e30" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">The best free stock photos in one place</blockquote><p name="cf40" id="cf40" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Here we see a bit of divergence. This is one of those self-embellishing taglines. “The best blank for blank” etc. There’s nothing wrong with that, just important to make a note of it. It does seem like the main point of the product was to concentrate all the high quality stock photo sites to one place. I’ve seen a ton of other sites do that same thing. So it’s interesting to me that Pexels did so well on PH. Perhaps the Maker Comment can give us some insight.</p><h4 name="e67f" id="e67f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Maker Comment</h4><figure name="d4eb" id="d4eb" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 448px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 64%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mI7cxXqDwA3NVpR2vT6fsg.png" data-width="722" data-height="462" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mI7cxXqDwA3NVpR2vT6fsg.png"></div></figure><p name="39b1" id="39b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Hmm, looks like this is in fact the second Pexels launch. Maybe the PH community at the time was already familiar with Pexels? PH does seem to have social darlings that it treats well. Underneath the greeting is a small feature/update list that starts out pretty specific and becomes kind of vague. The two top features are probably the most important pieces. Being able to search for colors is a pretty big feature improvement, and a popular photos category fills that same role. A way of finding the quality photos you want within a high quality photos collection.</p><h4 name="e17e" id="e17e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Notable Differences</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="0a00" id="0a00" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">This is v2 of a previously launched product.</li><li name="68a7" id="68a7" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Product is free, with monthly newsletter for monetization.</li></ul><h4 name="50a3" id="50a3" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion</h4><figure name="1be6" id="1be6" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 285px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 40.699999999999996%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*X61y6mycUJnpbZyUROS67A.png" data-width="710" data-height="289" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*X61y6mycUJnpbZyUROS67A.png"></div></figure><p name="51ea" id="51ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Bruno, the maker, mentions in the comments that this is the second time Pexels has appeared on PH. He also mentions that the company has iterated and learned from their first appearance. A product that has already done some iteration has a higher chance of doing well on PH. This could be evidence in favor of doing multiple PH launches, even if the first launch doesn’t go super well. It also happens to be a product that is built for PH’s target demographic: Makers.</p><h3 name="6abe" id="6abe" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product #3 Hunter</h3><h4 name="fb5e" id="fb5e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Description</h4><p name="aec7" id="aec7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">#3 in 2015 is Hunter with 5,417 upvotes and 115 comments. It’s in the “Marketing” category.</p><p name="529e" id="529e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Looks like it’s a tool for finding e-mails associated with a domain. Probably good for salespeople and cold emails. Neat.</p><h4 name="7d72" id="7d72" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Icon/Images</h4><figure name="6f81" id="6f81" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 102px; max-height: 99px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 97.1%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*bvCDJvEOqybqNb2ohIraEQ.png" data-width="102" data-height="99" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*bvCDJvEOqybqNb2ohIraEQ.png"></div></figure><p name="cdb2" id="cdb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">With Hunter we have our first logo! I dig it because it’s simple and seems to fit with the name pretty well. Dogs are man’s best friend, and that relationship goes way deeper than playing fetch with fluffy. It also happens to be PH orange. Maybe brighter colors do better?</p><h4 name="2659" id="2659" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tagline</h4><blockquote name="47f0" id="47f0" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">Find all the email addresses related to a domain</blockquote><p name="132b" id="132b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Simple and straight to the point, again. This seems to be a recurring trend. It’d be easy to say “a revolutionary tool for blah blah blah” when in fact people just want to know what the fuck the thing does quickly.</p><h4 name="d226" id="d226" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Maker Comment</h4><p name="07cf" id="07cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There isn’t one.</p><h4 name="b20f" id="b20f" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Notable Differences</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="e018" id="e018" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Hunter and Maker aren’t the same people.</li></ul><h4 name="b8dd" id="b8dd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion</h4><p name="4ce3" id="4ce3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This feels like someone else did this launch for Hunter, and it still went well anyway. The app that was launched is a bit different than it’s current iteration. Obviously, it’s three years old, but the comments make it seem like you didn’t even need to sign up for the PH launch version. It’s the third product in a row that had significant free features. Which makes sense, but it also means that setting a very low barrier to entry to your product could be important.</p><h3 name="b95c" id="b95c" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">2015 Bonus</h3><p name="fb23" id="fb23" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">When I started this I chose the top three products of each year, as an arbitrary sample size. The top three in each year should be enough to garner some information about what works and what doesn’t. However in the #4 slot of 2015 I saw something interesting, so I decided to do a bit more digging.</p><figure name="c55d" id="c55d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 552px; max-height: 113px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 20.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ItqBGsqMyy_LXHK94Kg0Jg.jpeg" data-width="552" data-height="113" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ItqBGsqMyy_LXHK94Kg0Jg.jpeg"></div></figure><p name="2e87" id="2e87" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">710 comments. That’s more than three times the next highest contender. Polymail was controversial. Let’s figure out why.</p><h3 name="10da" id="10da" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Product #4 Polymail</h3><h4 name="48e8" id="48e8" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">Description</h4><p name="5431" id="5431" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">#4 with 5,163 upvotes and a whopping 710 comments is Polymail. It’s in the “Productivity” category. It won the Golden Kitty in 2015, and is an E-Mail client for Mac. More products for makers.</p><h4 name="fc57" id="fc57" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Icon/Images</h4><figure name="fddc" id="fddc" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 91px; max-height: 88px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 96.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*_vFa0dGLSQitp68-hxMPqA.png" data-width="91" data-height="88" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*_vFa0dGLSQitp68-hxMPqA.png"></div></figure><p name="27ea" id="27ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Logo numero dos. Bright colors and a geometric shape. It’s eye catching and well designed. More evidence for bright colors, I suppose.</p><h4 name="8429" id="8429" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tagline</h4><blockquote name="6146" id="6146" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">A simple, beautiful, and powerful email client for Mac</blockquote><p name="5080" id="5080" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Here we come back a little bit to the nebulous words like ‘beautiful’ and ‘powerful’ for the tagline. Simple is an actionable word in my mind. By actionable I mean I can see the difference between a simple product and a complex product. The differences in a ‘beautiful’ product and a ‘powerful’ product is less… tangible to me. The other taglines seem to be a bit more descriptive of the actual product or what the product actually does. But then again how do you start talking about an email client without using this type of language? If they omitted the ‘simple and beautiful, etc’ it would just be “an email client for Mac” and that’s hardly compelling. Perhaps it has to do with what the unique proposition of your product is. Pexels for example is trying to compete with the other stock photography sites in it’s tagline — it’s saying “I’m better than the other stock photo sites you’ve used”. Polymail is saying it’s in a class of it’s own by not acknowledging other clients. It’s saying “check me out, I’m sleek and beautiful and there’s no competition for what I do.”</p><h4 name="c9dc" id="c9dc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Maker Comment</h4><figure name="270d" id="270d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h4"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 657px; max-height: 633px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 96.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*ccEfNUg5giNzVbhfMejkTg.png" data-width="657" data-height="633" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*ccEfNUg5giNzVbhfMejkTg.png"></div></figure><p name="22cf" id="22cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">A simple list of features and a little background info.

Why? Brandon Shin, one of the makers, responded to literally every comment/thread on the product with either a ‘thank you’ or an invite to the pre-launch product. That’s awesome, and I think a great idea. Definitely something I’m going to steal.</li></ul><h4 name="0b7b" id="0b7b" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Conclusion</h4><p name="3602" id="3602" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">List of features is once again present in the maker comment.

Now that we’ve got some data in front of us let’s try to go over what it can tell us, this is the fun part.</p><h4 name="34fe" id="34fe" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Description</h4><p name="b8ac" id="b8ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">In terms of what the product is about, thus far products that are targeted directly at the niche of users that actually make up the Product Hunt audience seem to do better than those that don’t. Surprise, surprise. This seems obvious after saying it, but I imagine some of us are releasing products on Product Hunt that aren’t meant for founders/makers. From this cursory investigation, you should take the market of your product into account when planning your Product Hunt launch. Can you target this more at the maker or entrepreneur space? Can you reasonably expect it to do well on PH?</p><p name="73cf" id="73cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two of the four products I included in this did have “Productivity” as it’s main tag.</p><h4 name="152e" id="152e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Icon/Images</h4><p name="a5af" id="a5af" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Looks like bright colors were ‘in’ in 2015. As far as the difference between screenshots and logos, we’re actually split 50/50 down the middle. Again as always we can only draw simple cursory conclusions from a sample size of four. Bright colors being effective at gaining attention, is pretty consistent across design disciplines, so it’d be a safe bet to make your icon/logo a bright color or something with high contrast.</p><h4 name="f301" id="f301" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Tagline</h4><p name="fc5d" id="fc5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">The tagline is likely to be the most important part of bringing a person into your product launch. The stats on this, I would guess, are the same as copywriting headlines, and blog titles, etc. The quality of your tagline should use most of your brain bandwidth when launching. Keep it simple, and describe what your product does in the most elegant way possible. Don’t use nebulous and confusing wording. Say what your product does.</p><h4 name="7f48" id="7f48" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Maker Comment</h4><p name="324e" id="324e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">I was surprised by the Maker Comments in general. I assumed there would be a lot more personal stories and information. “I’ve been doing x at y for z years and..” or some type of emotional story that caused them to build the product that they’re launching. People love stories, in general, and involving the emotions of the reader is almost always a good bet. However, we don’t really see any evidence of that in the first four products we’ve looked at. It looks like the format is a few short sentences describing the product and why it was built, followed by a list of the features/benefits underneath that. You can see examples of this in every product we’ve featured. In Polymail and Pexels they’re in actual formatted lists, and in Startup Stash the order is reversed, with a small paragraph describing the features, and short description of why the product was built. Simple. To the point.</p><h4 name="b057" id="b057" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Notable Differences</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="6483" id="6483" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Maker interaction in the comments seems to be important. (Polymail)</li><li name="f156" id="f156" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Taglines are all well crafted and say *exactly* what the product is/does (All)</li><li name="178e" id="178e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Logos are brightly colored. (Startup Stash, Hunter, Polymail)</li></ul><h4 name="5a6d" id="5a6d" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--li">Takeaways</h4><ul class="postList"><li name="8131" id="8131" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h4">Things that help makers likely do better than things that don’t.</li><li name="b718" id="b718" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Bright Logo (Maybe gif?)</li><li name="d777" id="d777" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Keep the tagline simple and to the point. Use concrete words.</li><li name="8190" id="8190" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Maker Comment short and to the point. Describe the product and features in the least amount of time possible.</li></ul><p name="2175" id="2175" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Thanks so much for reading everyone! I really appreciate it. Hopefully you’ve learned something about launching on PH. In the next few days I’ll probably also go over the other years of data and see if it’s in-line with what we’ve learned here. Keep in mind, the context and time means that some of the conclusions we’ve drawn here could be completely wrong. It all requires testing and thought. This is a way to organize the information and see what kind of ideas we can draw from it.</p><p name="095c" id="095c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">If you enjoyed this go ahead and clap it up for me, and give me a follow.

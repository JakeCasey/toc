If you haven’t read it, I suggest you do, because internet views are directly how I gauge my self-esteem.</p><p name="4a78" id="4a78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Not really but kind of.</p><p name="f353" id="f353" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yesterday we talked about <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">why </em>we should be in an abundance mindset. It just seems to make everything work better. We make better choices. We behave better, in a general sense. Less negative self-talk, more sharing of our resources and time, happier.</p><p name="2b5f" id="2b5f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">how </em>do we get to that feeling of abundance? How is it that we can pull ourselves out of a neutral or scarce mindset, into the present and into abundance?</p><blockquote name="9ecf" id="9ecf" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Set aside a certain number of days, during which you shall be content with the scantiest and cheapest fare, with coarse and rough dress, saying to yourself the while: ‘Is this the condition that I feared?’” — Seneca</blockquote><p name="768f" id="768f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">One is to understand, to really illustrate to yourself that what you have is enough. Perhaps this means committing to eating plain food for several days. Water and rice. But don’t think about it. Actually do it.</p><p name="472a" id="472a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When I was a bit younger, I was pretty poor, don’t worry, it was self inflicted. Not like.. bad off, but I wasn’t rich. Sometimes I would go dumpster diving. You heard me. I’d dig through dumpsters. Some of you may be disgusted (people who’ve never done it) or some of you may get a little sad. Both of these reactions are wrong. I’m not saying this to garner any pity, because dumpster diving is super fun, and a terribly interesting hobby. And I really recommend you do it. Read a few forums (oh yeah, there’s dumpster diving forums). At it’s worst it’s in the gray area of the law anyway, so just go out one night. Bring gloves. 80% of dumpsters is packaging, 15% is coffee grounds and the other 5% is cool shit. I used to go to this book store, and they would throw away books. Literally a dumpster full of books, taller than me. We would spend hours sorting through them under the dull yellow lights of the alley.</p><p name="d8e7" id="d8e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Right now you’re saying to yourself “There’s no way I would do that, this guy is crazy. I’m an adult. I do not go gallivanting out in the night digging through trash.” And that’s cool. I understand. It’s weird. What would people think of you? You couldn’t have somebody see you in a dumpster. Oh no.</p><p name="a350" id="a350" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, once you’ve been dumpster diving, you’ll realize that there’s nothing that can really stop you. You can find food, you can find things to sell. If I was stranded with just the clothes on my back (given it wasn’t winter, because winters in Wisconsin are brutal) I could survive, I could get back on my feet.</p><p name="bb08" id="bb08" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“Ok, but how do I get there without the dumpster diving?” Shortcuts, shortcuts. What a practice like that does is it puts into perspective what you have and what you don’t. And it tells you that what you have is enough. You can be thankful that you have shelter. That you don’t have to do something like that <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">to survive</em>. That you can fend for yourself. That you can go to the store and buy food. That you don’t need to scrounge for scraps. You have enough.</p><p name="7a73" id="7a73" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You need to occasionally spend time thinking about the fact that you’re happy for what you have. Do it consciously. Set aside time for it. Make a journal, whatever. Gratitude is this.. concept that comes up so frequently in self-help and philosophy literature that it makes my head spin. The more often you think about how thankful you are for what you have, the more it’s going to seem like a bounty. An overflow of wealth.</p><p name="ce61" id="ce61" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are so incredibly lucky to live in a place where we can walk down the street and buy a taco. A taco. We’re so lucky to have heat, and a bed, and a computer. We’re so lucky that sometimes we throw away food that has been sitting too long in our fridge. Think about that. Good food. Food that we were too lazy to cook, or just ‘didn’t feel like eating’. Insane. We’re so insanely lucky.</p><p name="a3a2" id="a3a2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spend some time thinking about it, and you won’t worry that your neighbor has a jet ski. What you have will be enough.</p><p name="4ed6" id="4ed6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Love you, bye.</p></div></div></section>

I can safely say I was happy I went. The staff was crazy welcoming and all-in-all just a really great group of nerds. I mean, of course they’re nerds. They’re running VR Arcade. So obviously we automatically felt right at home.</p><p name="70f3" id="70f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This, however, wasn’t my first VR experience. I had previously been to another VR experience. I wouldn’t call it so much an arcade, because you only got to pick between two games. And it certainly wasn’t a recent installation. It was at one of the water parks in Wisconsin Dells, I can’t remember exactly which right now.</p><p name="3c78" id="3c78" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now, don’t get me wrong, it was certainly an eye opening experience. Maybe not worth the 60 bucks I paid to do it, but definitely worth it just to catch a glimpse of the magic.</p><p name="463e" id="463e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What magic, you ask? There is something intangible, something so incredibly interesting about VR to me. I think it crops up in these little movements and moments that don’t feel like anything else I’ve ever done in a game before.</p><p name="dd6d" id="dd6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This particular game, at the VR Experience in the Dells, was a zombie shooter. First, my mask was kind of clouding up and it was funneling most of my breathing air straight up at the screen. Poor headset design, bad-ish sound. And even with all these things that destroyed the immersion of the game, I still found myself jumping when a zombie broke through a door, or rushed at me.</p><p name="1889" id="1889" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s that magic I was telling you about. It has this ability to produce really visceral, gut moving feelings. Vertigo, panic. All of these crazy feelings that are closer to real, intense emotions. I remember there was a tiny elevator that brought you up to the second story of the game.</p><p name="5356" id="5356" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I moved up, I fully expected the floor beneath my feet to be moving and shaking.</p><p name="d071" id="d071" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I left that experience with a newfound appreciation for VR. It convinced me then, even. However I hadn’t pursued the thought anymore. I can’t possibly afford to spend 60 dollars every time I wanted to experience it. And at the time a lot of the home VR setups seemed lackluster, and development hadn’t caught up with the hardware quite yet, I think.</p><p name="d1aa" id="d1aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But today? Today was a whole different story.</p><p name="0b76" id="0b76" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The headset fit snugly, and I was even provided with a little spacer that let me keep my glasses on during it. (That was a no-go in the last one) The space was new and clean and ultimately quite well done, even with an area for easy restaurant type food. Pizza, fries, that sort of thing.</p><p name="3cfc" id="3cfc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And the games. Man, the games.</p><p name="3d62" id="3d62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first we played was Quiver, basically human tower defense. Large mobs of monsters come running at you and you have only your trusty magic bow and arrow.</p><p name="eeef" id="eeef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was so incredibly entertaining to try to figure out the mechanics of a game like this. In a computer game your interaction with the mechanics is so incredibly limited. Press and hold, release to fire.</p><p name="c7b6" id="c7b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In Quiver you actually had to reach down into your quiver, grab an arrow, and nock it to your bow, then draw it, and fire it. Hoping to hit one of the massive horde of animals attacking you and your friends.</p><p name="6211" id="6211" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Oh yeah, I forgot to mention, your friends are in there with you, too. Teleporting from perch to perch, calling out when monsters are getting too close to your gates. It was incredibly fun.</p><p name="8757" id="8757" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then came beatsaber. The quintessential music-DDR-esque timing game where you attempt to swipe through 3D blocks flying at you with your two lightsabers.</p><p name="f222" id="f222" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s incredibly fun. It’s just <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">fun.</em> It’s hard for me to remember the last time I had this much fun with games. Sure games are ‘fun’, they’re definitely entertaining. But this was just so different, getting your whole body into it has something to do with it. I found myself dancing a little bit along to the beat of the game. It was incredible.</p><p name="7d21" id="7d21" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And last, but definitely not least, was my favorite. Super Hot VR. Now I had heard of and seen tons of videos for Super Hot for the PC. The slow down mechanics looked awesome, and I loved the art styling of the game, so I had to see how it looked in VR.</p><p name="ad14" id="ad14" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s amazing.</p><p name="6b35" id="6b35" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The game menu is simply you in a room, filled with steampunk-esque computers. You load a floppy disk into the drive, and a white light shines down on you. Looking up — physically tilting your head back and looking above you — you realize there’s another VR helmet, hanging in the room you’re in. Reaching up, you pull it down over your head, and the game begins.</p><p name="7ee6" id="7ee6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How fucking cool is that?!</p><p name="b5c9" id="b5c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The game was both challenging and incredibly entertaining. The permadeath features of SuperHot lend it to attempting the same task over and over and over again, and it never got tiring.</p><p name="531e" id="531e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The only unfortunate thing was as always: all good things must come to an end. Our little timer went off, and our games were shut down.</p><p name="3946" id="3946" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I was left just being blown away.</p><p name="edbf" id="edbf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m already looking at graphics cards and processor upgrades for my PC.</p><p name="0058" id="0058" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">I see more VR in the future. At least for me.</p></div></div></section>

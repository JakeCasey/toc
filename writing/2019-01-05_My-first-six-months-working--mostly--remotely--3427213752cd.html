Cool. I’ve never applied for a developer position. That’s awesome. Alright. Cool. Great. Cool. I haven’t interviewed for any job I’ve gotten in the past 10 years. I mean, those have been bartending, working at a hostel in Vietnam, and delivering sandwiches for Jimmy John’s. Not exactly office jobs. I’m not nervous at all. This is fine. Everything is fine.</p><p name="dde2" id="dde2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I hadn’t applied to a dev job yet. I mean, I was thinking of applying to a few places. But at the time I was a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">bartender.</em> I made cocktails, not software. I mean sure, I was knee deep in my second full stack web application. But I think I just didn’t see myself as one yet. I just wrote code for fun, after all. Nobody was paying me to do it, so it was a hobby, not a skill.</p><p name="86d4" id="86d4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But luckily I was sought out. Which is cool. A friend of mine owns the company, a marketing firm in Madison, WI. I partially think he did it because he knew that if he didn’t hire me I’d probably never apply for anything. So thanks, man. I appreciate it.</p><p name="76e7" id="76e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I took the interview. It was quick and relatively painless. They said I’d start on Monday, and somehow I had walked into a job writing code remotely.</p><p name="0af6" id="0af6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was also my birthday. So happy birthday, me.</p><p name="df5c" id="df5c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">First. Remote work is weird.</p><p name="8515" id="8515" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When it comes to my job I’m a pretty serious guy. If I’m a minute or two late I’m pretty upset. I stress about the quality of work I’m doing nearly constantly. I tend to be very comitted to the company I work for and the job that I’m doing. Jobs are meant to be done right.</p><p name="b4ae" id="b4ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But now instead of working face-to-face with people all day, I have a little task manager, that holds all the stuff I need to get done. And if I get it done then I’m done. Sure, there’s deadlines. So if I didn’t want to work exactly right now, then I didn’t really have to, as long as I knew I could get it done before the deadline of course. I could take 10 minutes to get my coffee, or get my morning workout in before-hand.</p><p name="6654" id="6654" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I basically realized that this is my holy grail.</p><p name="ab20" id="ab20" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s low stress. I never realized how stressed work made me. I can listen to my own music. Or not. I can work in pants. Or not. But I think the real massive takeaway is, I’m happier. I’m happier working from home. I like having my coffee and sitting in the sun and maybe sending a message to some of my entrepreneur friends every once n’ a while. Sometimes when I’m feeling burnt out, or I can’t concentrate, I stop (turn off my timer!) and play some games, and come back to work ultimately refreshed and ready to crush tasks beneath my bootheel.</p><p name="6696" id="6696" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those of you reading this are probably like “Wow, look at this asshole, with his fancy remote job. I hope he dies in a fire.” Alright, alright, I’m sorry.</p><p name="2197" id="2197" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Here’s some of the drawbacks, I don’t feel as much of a kinship with my co-workers as I could. Most of them, aside from my friend, live in Madison, over an hour and a half drive away. I’ve met them once, and I obviously value their contributions and their work, but we don’t really joke around the watercooler, so to speak. I do my work, sit down, and shut up. For someone who has literally been “the sociable guy” his whole life, it’s a bit weird to spend days not interacting with anyone.</p><p name="1fa1" id="1fa1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Quick benefit: The whole dynamic between people is different in the real world. In the service industry we’re basically subservient to the customer. Prey to their whim and bluster. I had a guy threaten to knock me out because the wait for his sushi was too long, once. Let that sink in. When was the last time you were threatened at work? Or even like, yelled at? Like really, vein-poppingly yelled at. Here though, I’m a real person, so that’s cool.</p><p name="fd39" id="fd39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back to the drawbacks: Since the work is task based, there’s not a whole lot of internal feedback. So when I finish a task I’m ultimately uncertain if I did a good job. That sounds like “Praise me, praise me!” and part of it probably is, but I think it’s also important to know where you stand in regards to your quality of work. I think I’m doing a good job, but am I? Are they secretly devising a way to stuff me in the trunk of a car and drive me off a bridge? Who knows?</p><p name="dc31" id="dc31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, I do actually have some work to do, so I’ll have to cut this blog post short!</p><p name="2aad" id="2aad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Yo if this interests you, if it’s cool, if it’s hip, it would really make me happy if you share it, clap for it, comment on it, whatever. A retweet goes a long way let me tell you what. Especially since I directly associate my self worth with the amount of views I get. Ha ha ha.

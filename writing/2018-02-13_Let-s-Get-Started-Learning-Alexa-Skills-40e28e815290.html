I’ve heard of Alexa, but not her madd skills.</p><p name="1503" id="1503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The rest of the book is excellent stories of people who read Crush It (his first book), and their success stories, along with tactical info on a lot of the other content platforms that Gary Vee is most famous for using.

Awright, so now we head over to the dreaded Amazon site to learn a bit more about skills, and how to build them.</p><h3 name="67b6" id="67b6" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Skillz</h3><p name="09b3" id="09b3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Maybe it’s just me, but I don’t like Amazon’s developer stuff. Probably because I’m basically uninitiated to AWS, but a lot of it seems overly obscured or overly complicated. So when you’re going through the first few pages of Alexa Skills a lot of stuff is like “It can do this! And this! Isn’t that cool?” and there’s very little tangible information. It’s like some of the pages have been written to appeal to casual users, when they should be written to developers. It makes the documentation and navigation confusing, to me. <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/webinars" data-href="https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/webinars" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">They do however link to what seems to be a handy list of webinars and platforms for learning how to build your Skills</a>. But this itself is geared more towards developers, which I happen to be, so that’s ok, but I could imagine it could be confusing for somebody who just wants to know wtf is going on.</p><p name="3c88" id="3c88" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alright, so we clicked the “Start a Skill” and after signing our life away, and giving more information to Amazon, they let us get to a dashboard. Looks like this.</p><figure name="bc3e" id="bc3e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 470px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 67.10000000000001%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*KEa78LxQUxv1MCY-h3xb-A.png" data-width="1313" data-height="881" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*KEa78LxQUxv1MCY-h3xb-A.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Amazon App Dashboard</figcaption></figure><p name="c852" id="c852" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">So we clicked on Alexa&gt;Add a new Skill</p><p name="d785" id="d785" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yikes.

The first thing about being a dev is you need to be able to read documentation. If you’re just coming here as a marketer or brand guy, this is part of what Gary Vee talks about, you have to put in the time to learn a new platform. Luckily I’m gonna learn with you, so we can figure it out, together. In true dev fashion we just click the ‘learn more’ link, and try to grok what’s happening.</p><p name="de38" id="de38" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we get sent to a list of Skill Types.</p><figure name="d883" id="d883" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 110px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 15.7%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jLek4uWqQuc8pWQRYJVRGQ.png" data-width="858" data-height="135" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jLek4uWqQuc8pWQRYJVRGQ.png"></div></figure><p name="fcf7" id="fcf7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Jesus Christ it’s a Tide Ad.

(haha). These are completely custom skills, designed by developers from the ground up.</p><blockquote name="cf35" id="cf35" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">A custom skill can handle any kind of request, so long as you can create the code to fulfill the request and provide appropriate data in the interaction model to let users invoke the request. This is the most flexible kind of skill you can build, but also the most complex, since you need to provide the interaction model.</blockquote><p name="7b97" id="7b97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">This means that you build the intents that your skill can accept. An intent in this case is something like “Order a pizza” or “Call me an Uber”. After which, you would also build what happens on the back end, or what actually happens because of the intent. You could build something that says “Alexa, pick my <a href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/lets-turn-the-volume-up-61e42cf1f39d" data-href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/lets-turn-the-volume-up-61e42cf1f39d" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">Storytime</a> articles for today.” and then she sends you your custom built podcast from our wide selection of RSS feeds. (It’s literally just me in there right now guys, don’t get too excited. We’re still building /shameless plug end)</p><figure name="416d" id="416d" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 320px; max-height: 320px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*o3XmNVjmjnPS-atbYQrH1A.gif" data-width="320" data-height="320" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*o3XmNVjmjnPS-atbYQrH1A.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">Yeah, I’ve got skills.</figcaption></figure><h4 name="b172" id="b172" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Smart Home Skills</h4><p name="97bf" id="97bf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Our second skill comes in with a framework that we can begin to build things on, however it’s probably one of the more niche skills, requiring actual hardware as well. This abstracts the controls of various home-based commands to a unified VPI (Voice program interface? Did I just make something cool up? Just kidding I checked they’re already using VUI which is close enough. Damn.) meaning you can just say “Alexa, turn on my microwave”. Because in the future our microwaves will be voice controlled too, imo. From the docs:</p><blockquote name="6838" id="6838" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">You</em> (as the developer) define how your skill responds to a particular directive. For instance, you write the code that makes a light turn on when your skill receives a “turn on the light” directive. This code is hosted as an AWS Lambda function. Note that a skill built with the Smart Home Skill API can respond only to the requests (device directives) supported by the API.</blockquote><p name="6b7b" id="6b7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">If you’re a dev, there’s a little more you can dive into there, but if you’re a marketer, this skill probably won’t have much use for you. But it’s still freakin’ cool. Smart homes are gonna be the future, guarantee it.</p><h4 name="88cc" id="88cc" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Flash Briefing Skills</h4><p name="154e" id="154e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Here’s the skill that gets the most air time in Crushing It. Probably for good reason, as this is pretty in line with Gary V’s microcontent strategies. Making creative content that’s along the same lines as the rest of your social media presence, in small easily digestible experiences. Hopefully without making you mad, Gary, in the book you tell a small story that does an excellent job illustrating the potential of the flash briefing. It’s the story of an etiquette teacher, who, long story short, records themselves answering tons of common etiquette questions, and then forms intents for these in an Alexa Skill. So the user can just say “Hey Alexa, does the fork go on the left or right side of the plate?” And her voice would play with a little snippet of info instructing that it goes on the right side because of X reasons. I’m not an etiquette coach, this is an example, if you ruin your night with a head of state or a prime minister don’t yell at me, ok?</p><p name="a64d" id="a64d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you don’t get why this is cool, you’re mad. You could turn YOURSELF into a VIRTUAL ASSISTANT. One day You could get professional investing advice from Warren Buffet or something ridiculous like that. Given enough time and diligence, you could build one yourself. Let’s say you’re an expert on.. flower arrangements. “Alexa, what’s the best flowers to get your Mom for Mother’s day?” And your voice pipes up giving expert advice. “Alexa, what’s the best whiskey I can buy?” A soft soothing voice informs them that some obscure scotch is where it’s at. You can hear the moustache wax dripping off every word. It’s awesome. I imagine in the near future “Alexa, how do I build a following on Instagram?” and Gary V’s voice is going to rock up and say “OK LISTEN, find the top 10 hashtags and GIVE VALUE.”</p><p name="29da" id="29da" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">See how cool that is?</p><figure name="95b9" id="95b9" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 358px; max-height: 198px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 55.300000000000004%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*LDR9ajnf6UsdY-LLNPnOgg.gif" data-width="358" data-height="198" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*LDR9ajnf6UsdY-LLNPnOgg.gif"></div></figure><h4 name="8600" id="8600" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--figure">Video Skills</h4><p name="1507" id="1507" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">This one is pretty straightforward and seems less ‘interesting’ than the flash briefing, but it’s up to you to find new and novel ways to use it. Essentially it provides an intent that lets you play a video immediately. One of the best applications in my opinion would be cooking. “Alexa, show me how to julienne a carrot” and your skill plays just a clip explaining how to julienne, or debone a chicken, or how to make a roux. Simple, effective content that helps people. I always measure stuff by whether or not I’d use something. And I’d use that. If I had an Alexa. (If this goes viral Amazon you can send me one as thanks, I won’t mind.) I’ll probably end up picking one up soon anyways just to play around with this, so don’t worry if you can’t spare one.</p><h4 name="a0e4" id="a0e4" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">List Skills</h4><blockquote name="1eae" id="1eae" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--h4">A list skill facilitates the use of <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/list-events-in-alexa-skills.html" data-href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/list-events-in-alexa-skills.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list events</a> in the skill service. Thus, the skill can understand and react to changes that happen to lists from top-level utterances on Alexa.</blockquote><blockquote name="395f" id="395f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">A <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/steps-to-create-a-list-skill.html" data-href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/steps-to-create-a-list-skill.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">list skill is created</a> through the <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html" data-href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/smapi/ask-cli-intro.html" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ASK CLI (Alexa Skills Kit Command Line Interface)</a>.</blockquote><blockquote name="13f9" id="13f9" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">A list skill may include an optional custom component, which can include any features allowed for <a href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/understanding-the-different-types-of-skills.html#custom-skills" data-href="https://developer.amazon.com/docs/ask-overviews/understanding-the-different-types-of-skills.html#custom-skills" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">custom skills</a>, in addition to list skill features.</blockquote><p name="1215" id="1215" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">I think the key bit is the last one. You can INCLUDE custom skills in your list skills. If you remember from a little bit ago, custom skills can do pretty much whatever you want them to, at the cost that you’ll probably need an actual developer to implement them. So now I’m thinking of something like “Alexa, add more cereal to my grocery list.” but this isn’t just any grocery list. This one’s practically Skynet, and it knows your favorite cereal is Cheerios, and it hooks up to some complex drone powered cereal delivery system, and it also knows that your milk is expired so it brings that, too. Or something equally cool. The point is, you can add something to a list and you can take actions on that list. That’s my understanding of how this’d work anyway. Remember, we’re learning together here.</p><figure name="02f0" id="02f0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 470px; max-height: 264px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 56.2%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*v0SJ5e5JcmAtUH3jVv7-PA.gif" data-width="470" data-height="264" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*v0SJ5e5JcmAtUH3jVv7-PA.gif"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">or beer.</figcaption></figure><p name="0355" id="0355" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Holy cow, G was right.

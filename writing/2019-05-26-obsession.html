        <h1>Everybody has something to obsess over.</h1>
        <p>We are defined by our thought patterns. Cue, thought. Cue, thought. Humans are largely reactive creatures. We smell the slightly sweet smell of grass clippings and think of childhood summers or your grass allergy or any of the million other connections you’ve made to that smell. A cue, the smell of grass, and a thought. It poofs into existence. Thoughts tend to slip into our minds and take them over completely. For a small moment your whole being is focused on that one thing. Sure, it can switch back to the task at hand nearly instantaneously. Sometimes so fast that we immediately forget the thought we just had. But the thought has still ocurred.
                We tend to follow similar patterns. A similar conversation, with similar content sometimes prompts the same stories. Have you ever noticed that a friend of yours, in maybe very similar situations or in topics of discussion, weaves the same tale? They may tell that story, with the same gusto and belief as if you’d never heard it before, because they were prompted by the same conditions as when you first heard the story. Someone mentions a pool and your friend tells his story of nearly drowning. Something like that.
                There’s nothing wrong with this, it’s simply to illustrate that we tend to function in cycles. And in these cycles we build up our personality. Our actions and our behavior is born out of these patterns of thought.
                What does this mean for us then?
                It means that we’re largely just creatures of what we’re obsessed with at the current moment. Everyone has obsessions, or points of interest. Things that they’re focused on. Maybe pillars of their personality or self-image. Vegans telling you they’re vegan, that’s a pillar of their personality. It’s part of what they see themselves as. Entrepreneurs tend to focus and obsess about the process, the business, the community. I’m a maker. I’m an entrepreneur. I’m a business owner. I’m trying to start a business. I’m a weed smoker, I’m a doctor, whatever.
                It can also be habits and wants. I’m a runner, I’m on keto. Maybe it’s exclusive groups. I belong to the local country club, I’m a millionaire.
                ‘What does this mean’, you’re saying. ‘Of course people are built up of their habits and thoughts.’
                What I’m saying is that this focus is largely singular. I think that often we pick just ONE of these things. That thing may change and ebb and flow, but for the most part it’s a singular thing. And that thing acts like a social touchstone on how we act and behave. It also likely determines or at least has a huge effect on who we consider our friends. On what stories we tell at parties. On what we eat, even! It is our own personal obsession.
                We must be aware of this personality tunnel vision; this obsession. Of this self-image and focus on belonging to a tribe or a group or activity, in ourselves and others.
                The singularity of the role is the important part, I think. We are all of course a mother, a brother, a sister, a father, a friend. A boss, an employee. We’re all of these people all the time. However, they’re presented and focused at different times in different places. So when you and an old friend grow apart over the years, perhaps it’s a divergence of your obsessions. Perhaps that’s not a bad thing.
                We are all obsessed with something. There is something that we pine over, we meticulously examine and enrich ourselves with. Writers write. Painters paint. Entrepreneurs entrepreneur.
                This obsession blinds us to vast amounts of information. I haven’t found the reason why, yet, but I think that being ‘detached’ is at the core of success and achievement in a lot of areas of life. And I believe this obsession is at the center of our attachment to results and how we validate our actions.
                What is your primary role? Are you aware of it? Is it beneficial? What if you tried a different role for a while? What if you completely flipped it on it’s head?
                Perhaps your obessions need to be monitored, adjusted. Do you see yourself as a creative person? No? Do something creative. Try it. See how it feels. And vice versa. Are you largely creative? Work on something technical.
                Something tells me it will inform your life elsewhere.
                Something tells me it’s good for you.</p>

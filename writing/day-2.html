      <h2>Day # 2</h2>

      <p>I have a hard time with selfless creation.</p>

      <p>I think it's important.</p>

      <p>
        I think people should be building things to give value to the betterment
        of society. I struggle with that idea sometimes when building things.
        How to take value-- how can I make money-- seeps into the things we do.
        It's some creeping fungus that poisons budding good intentions. Trying
        to squeeze every dollar out of your customer is needful, it is 'taking',
        it is 'scarcity'. I think taking value and scarcity are what ultimately
        causes many businesses and entrepreneurs to fail.
      </p>

      <p>
        Goddamnit, I want to make a living doing my own thing though. Is that so
        wrong?
      </p>

      <p>
        So, I suppose, here are some words on being genuine and why sometimes
        fake it til you make it isn't the play.
      </p>

      <p>
        First, and foremost, I want to mention that I just think this is the
        best way of success. Not the only way. You CAN fake it til you make it.
        You CAN have no skin in the game and still build a massive company. But
        it's harder, and here's why.
      </p>

      <p>The best work comes from a place of joy.</p>

      <p>
        I think it comes from somebody just saying "Fuck it let's build this
        weird thing."
      </p>

      <p>
        Or from passion, "The world absolutely needs this and I'm going to build
        it whether or not somebody ever uses it, because
        <em>it needs to exist</em>."
      </p>

      <p>
        These are genuine feelings. Real, honest, true feelings. Genuine
        thoughts, feelings, and motivations are what, I believe, helps some
        entrepreneurs succeed. There is no layer of ambiguity separating the
        creator and the consumer of the product.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you're creating from this genuine place, it's all on the table.
        There's no pretending that the exchange of money and services isn't what
        it is. The interaction can move smoothly and beautifully.
      </p>

      <p>
        Customers, like wild animals, can smell fear. But customers, unlike wild
        animals, can also smell disingenuousness. They can tell when a creator
        isn't giving. When a creator isn't really trying to give the value they
        want to give. There's a catch. They're trying to take. This is what
        holds a lot of us back from success. Myself included.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, ultimately, how do we combat it? Even in ourselves, as entrepreneurs
        of all types, how do we stop the poison from creeping into our products
        and the things that we do?
      </p>

      <p>
        The easiest way is to have fun and be honest. If you're having fun
        building your product, real fun, it shields your work from this
        disingenuousness. You should do weird and whacky shit because you want
        to. You should build a few things just to see how they turn out, not
        expecting to make money at all. I think you should enjoy the work that
        you put into them, however you have to justify it to yourself to do so.
        Fun helps you be a little less outwardly validated, and that's big.
      </p>

      <p>
        And I think we need to be more honest, with ourselves and with the
        people who use our products. Perhaps you're not passionate about the
        vertical you're in. That's ok, as long as you're passionate about
        something else in the fulfillment of that vertical. Let's say you sell
        washing machines. Perhaps you don't like washing machines, but you love
        the art and craft of selling them. Or you love the engineering of them.
        Whatever.
      </p>

      <p>
        You don't have to love the whole package. But you absolutely must be
        honest with yourself and everyone else where you stand in regards to
        your product. The one thing you cannot do is pretend. About pretty much
        anything. Be genuine. Be you. Be a struggling entrepreneur who comes
        from low-income background. Or be the struggling entrepreneur who comes
        from a rich family, it doesn't matter. But you have to be that, not
        anything else.

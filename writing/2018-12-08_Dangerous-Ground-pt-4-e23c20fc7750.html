The same start that you get when you tip back too far in your chair, or the one where you jolt just before falling asleep. It was the intense whole body fear you experience when you get pushed off of a tall building in a dream.</p><p name="5b8c" id="5b8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">God, it was so cold. So mind numbingly stupidly cold. Her arms and back ached. Her legs ached and her whole body ached. Her vest crinkled and cracked, flakes of dried blood floating off in the wind around her. She tried to rub it off, with a numb hand. She rubbed the back of her hand across her nose, clearing her running nose, and pressed her fingertips against her eyes, clearing them of the dried crusted blood.</p><p name="672f" id="672f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She could see far from here. She could see the cabin, and the little river that ran nearby. The water reflecting in tumbling flashes of light, and then slithering out of her view, beneath the treeline. Her hands were bloody. She stared at their backs, studying her chipped fingernail polish, it was a light pink. She could see black blood pooling beneath one of the fingernails she had smashed in her escape. Her palms were scratched, and abraded. Torn up. She could see a bit of her own blood on one of the branches below her. She shifted her weight and looked down from her perch, near the top of a tall fir tree.</p><p name="f7f0" id="f7f0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The quiet was what unnerved her the most. Up here, it was peaceful. Tranquil. She heard a chick-a-dee in a nearby tree trill it’s call. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Chick-a-dee-dee-dee. </em>She wanted to throw a rock at it, but there’s no rocks at the top of a tree. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Chick-a-dee-dee-dee.</em> The squirrels chattered at her endlessly. Get out of my tree, they said. These are my nuts. My trees. Get out. She wanted to throw rocks at them, too.</p><p name="bf1b" id="bf1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She couldn’t tell who’s blood this was. Maybe Steven’s? Maybe hers? She stared at it. Her jacket was ruined. Mom bought me this, she thought. She scratched at her chest and long flakes of blood sloughed into her palms. She wiped it on the trunk of the tree. She repeated this until her jacket was dyed a dull brown and not a bright red anymore.</p><p name="8827" id="8827" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She shifted and felt one of the knots in her legs release. She hadn’t run that long in ages. Her foot throbbed in her shoe. She loosened one of the laces, and felt a wave of relief wash over her. The squirrel in the tree next to her had given up defending his territory, resigning himself to simply keep a watchful eye on the intruder.</p><p name="6758" id="6758" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There was movement atop the cabin. A figure, indistinguishable from this distance, mounted the roof. She sat forward on her branch, leaning around the center trunk, shielding her eyes from the dying light.</p><p name="b730" id="b730" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She could see the patch of blood that painted one side of the figure, dull brown from this distance. After their initial burst of energy, they laid on their back, staring into the sky. She wanted to call out to them. To let them know she was there. To let them know that it wasn’t just squirrels and angry birds and dead leaves and death out in this forest. She was still alive. She was still here.</p><p name="8461" id="8461" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She couldn’t force the words from her mouth. Terror gripped her with it’s bony fingers nestled around her throat. Her diaphragm contracted as she tried to force herself to yell. She doubled over with the force of it. Tears streamed down her face.</p><p name="7dad" id="7dad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The birds and squirrels and even the trees were silent for a time. The wind had died down. The figure hadn’t moved. It lay there, supine. Offering hisself, herself, to the Gods.</p><p name="7c3f" id="7c3f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She could only remember laying like that, arms and legs stretched out to the sides, once. Her first marathon, she had collapsed at the finish line, chest heaving. Her friends and family cooed and congratulated her, while really all she could focus on was the unending blue of the sky, and the feeling of air in her lungs. All she had wanted was fresh air, and a beer.</p><p name="51f8" id="51f8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She became resolute then, noting the direction of the cabin. West-ish. She wrapped her arms around the trunk and swung one of her legs to a branch slightly lower than the one she sat on, and began making her way down.</p><p name="e6db" id="e6db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the haze of her adrenaline withdrawal, she figured the descent took longer than the ascent. She noted several places where the smears of blood, either from her hands or her clothes, had marked the tree in long streaks.</p><p name="ffcf" id="ffcf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Another squirrel, clearly unaffiliated with the squirrel who owned the tops of this tree, stared at her with mild interest as she made her way to the last branch before the ground. It made a few tentative hops, in the loping way that squirrels do. His tail twitched, swishing in the air. At least he wasn’t yelling, she thought.</p><p name="2926" id="2926" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She stared at the ground with trepidation. She now squatted on the last branch, supporting and balancing herself atop it, like some ridiculous bird impersonator. The squirrel probably thought she was insane. She turned her head, noting the direction of the cabin one more time.</p><p name="462e" id="462e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Then she jumped.</p><p name="a589" id="a589" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">As soon as her feet hit the ground, she felt it tremble. The ground cracked, and crashed and she could hear it and feel it. She could feel it rumbling and vibrating with the awful noise of stone grinding against stone. She no more registered that before she was off, her Nike’s, now covered with dirt and destroyed, dug into the soil, and propelled her toward the cabin.</p></div></div></section>

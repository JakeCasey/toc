Why is it unfinished? Because I’m still working on it. Right now. As we speak. I think that there’s a benefit to writing down unfinished thoughts. Since I can’t think about this topic all day every day, it’ll give me a dog ear, a bookmark to come back to when I’ve finished thinking about it.</p><p name="fee9" id="fee9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Who knows, maybe I’m not the guy to explain this topic. There’s a good solid chance I lack the education and acumen to properly explain this idea that’s floating around in my head. But the only thing I can do is try. So maybe a lot of these articles will be about things that aren’t the theory of detachment. And maybe some of them will be. Like this one.</p><p name="d894" id="d894" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I have these ideas that I’m obsessed with. Base ideas. Ideas that I think govern mass swathes of nature. Ideas that describe how the parts and pieces of the great machine that is our world, work together. It really is a machine.</p><p name="24fa" id="24fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I pull back on the ball of a Newton’s Cradle and drop it, there is a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">reaction. </em>And if global warming isn’t put into check, there will be a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">reaction. </em>If I were to walk out into the street right now, and punch someone in the face, there would be a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">reaction.</em></p><p name="9edc" id="9edc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are inputs and outputs and no matter at what scale you pull back to, from the atomic to the macro, it’s a system. It’s a machine. There’s actions and reactions. Some are expected, and others are unexpected.</p><p name="d6a5" id="d6a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And I think there are principles that govern these interactions. So Detachment is only one of two grand overarching principles that I’ve discovered so far. Detachment and Iteration. There might be a third called Volume, but I’m not sure if it’s part of Iteration or not.</p><p name="e8b5" id="e8b5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Detachment is not a new thing. It appears in Buddhism under the term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up%C4%81d%C4%81na" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Up%C4%81d%C4%81na" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" title="Upādāna" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">upādāna</em></a><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">, </em>literally ‘attachment’, the primary barrier to living a serene life. In Stoicism it’s taught that the ultimate virtue is living in accordance with nature, being in the present moment and taking things as they come. It’s your behavior in response to nature that defines you. In Taoism as well: the concept of ‘wu-wei’ — action without intent.</p><p name="46c7" id="46c7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What about systems vs goals, as expounded by Scott Adams? It’s just another form of this idea: that instead of relying on fragile motivation to accomplish things, you simply set up a system and follow the system. It removes the emotional part. The attachment to the outcome.</p><p name="922e" id="922e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, I wanted to write more. Writing is difficult for some. In reality the actual difficult part isn’t the writing, it’s the anxiety before the writing. So now I just write 10 minutes a day. If I’m done after 10 minutes, then I’m done. If I’m not, then I keep going and see where it leads. This is a system. Not a goal. I’m impartial about it. Yesterday I missed a day. Oops. Today I didn’t miss it. I have no emotions attached to it. I just write. If it’s good, great, if it’s bad, well, I finished my 10 minutes so that’s all that really matters. I’ve written more in the last 10 days than I have in likely the last 10 months. My goal is being accomplished.</p><p name="6b09" id="6b09" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But here is the kicker: I see these principles elsewhere in my own life. I see it with my own eyes. Sometimes I feel like the action of grasping for something with desperation is the least effective way to attain something. Almost anything, to be honest. I can’t find a good example of something where detachment doesn’t increase your chances of success.</p><p name="ce08" id="ce08" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The best counter-argument I can come up with is success in sports or other innately competitive arenas. The only way I can combat this is by saying that I think these actions, success and skill in something like this, is developed because the skills are intensely engrained into a person. Of course they want to win, but the actual action of winning is likely done in a ‘flow state’ a state in which they’re just performing actions as per their training and previous experience. Perhaps they’re less thinking about ‘winning’ and more about ‘performing their best’.</p><p name="0ef8" id="0ef8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This idea, this detachment ties back to so many things it makes my head spin. Playfulness and detachment from the outcome and response. Creation for creation’s sake. “Fuck it, let’s do it.” often turns out better than expected. It is doing something for the sake of it having been done. Nothing else.</p><p name="8440" id="8440" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What about business? My friend <a href="https://twitter.com/pugson" data-href="https://twitter.com/pugson" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Pug</a> has an excellent example of this principle in action:</p><figure name="fa52" id="fa52" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/pugson/status/1045008302176964608"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="ee3c" id="ee3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">If you check the website <a href="https://excuseme.wtf" data-href="https://excuseme.wtf" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://excuseme.wtf</a> you can see that he’s sold a whopping 124 E-mails. Who knows if that’s fully updated. But at 5 dollars a pop that’s… let me do the math for you.. That’s 620 dollars. For a one off idea that probably took him 15 minutes to set up. Think about that for just one second. The efficiency of that idea and execution is mindblowing. I know for sure, when he put that up there he wasn’t thinking “I hope this makes 600 bucks” he was thinking “This is hilarious.”</p><p name="3b4f" id="3b4f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s the difference. It’s a huge one. It has wide ranging effects that I’m still trying to figure out myself. Businesses that focus on providing value for the sake of the value provided will be successful more than ones trying to screw over their customers. Just think about it. It’s the non-attachment to the money that lets the money move.</p><p name="426d" id="426d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And it’s not just the action of grasping for something. The action of grasping for something happens in both successful and unsuccessful attempts. The action is separate from the intent. It’s like the intent has this weird metaphysical effect on the outcome. Two people can take the exact same actions and come up with two completely different results and sometimes I think the only difference is the intent.</p><p name="21ac" id="21ac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">My time was up a while ago. I’ll catch you guys tomorrow.</p><p name="e327" id="e327" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Love you, bye.</p></div></div></section>

It tends to get all up inside you. It’s emotional. More than it should be. People may think, ‘Oh well, a regular job that’s emotional, too.’ I’d say it’s different, but that’s just my ego speaking.</p><p name="6661" id="6661" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When somebody is an entrepreneur, or wants to be one, it’s a part of them. Not just any part, not just the ‘business’ part. It’s not ‘just what I do to make money’ part. It’s the big part. It’s who you are when you wake up and eat breakfast and it’s who you are when you’re at your other job.</p><figure name="a42e" id="a42e" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 200px; max-height: 153px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 76.5%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*jBlygTiPTLirQtVLXrKQAA.gif" data-width="200" data-height="153" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*jBlygTiPTLirQtVLXrKQAA.gif"></div></figure><p name="a6e6" id="a6e6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">That part of you that identifies as an entrepreneur, it’s tied with failure. It’s tied so closely with failure, uncertainty, and fear. This is the problem with entrepreneurship, I think. Is this connection with yourself, and how you see yourself. When you tie your self worth and any view of yourself to entrepreneurship, you ultimately tie yourself to an anchor that will bring you down.</p><p name="535b" id="535b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is the primary reason of failure in entrepreneurship, in my opinion, because failure and rejection is inherent in this process. People are bound to not like something you’ve built, people are bound to reject you for the clothes you wore that day or the way you said ‘Hi’. So much of it is complete and random chance.</p><p name="4f3a" id="4f3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you really, honestly, think that an investor would make the same choices <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">every single time</em> they are presented with the same opportunity? Of fucking course not. People can barely choose what they want for lunch. They all struggle with insecurity and strife and poor marriages and poor relationships. They struggle with their weight gain, or with their weight loss. They’re all humans, often completely preoccupied and running on heuristics that can be effected by any number of completely arbitrary events. Humans do not behave logically. They do not make logical choices every single time.</p><figure name="a331" id="a331" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 200px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 50%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*8uUVwl1ZX-SX0Y9mjvwTtw.gif" data-width="400" data-height="200" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*8uUVwl1ZX-SX0Y9mjvwTtw.gif"></div></figure><p name="9b7b" id="9b7b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Now before you get up in arms, I’m not saying they’re flipping coins. What I am saying is you could be rejected for a million other reasons than ‘Your product sucks, and you suck for making it, and you should probably give up and go back to the office.’ You could be rejected because somebody cut them off in traffic that day, or they’re late to their next meeting and they want to get this over with. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It can be other stuff</em>.</p><p name="9d69" id="9d69" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, it can also be that your product sucks. I know, I know, I spend all this time giving you hope, only to pull the tablecloth out from under the silverware like some fucked up magic trick.</p><p name="6b47" id="6b47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is where the big payoff comes in. I always talk about this connection between the ego and what you’re working on, and I think entrepreneurs everywhere could benefit from this shift in thinking. Especially myself, because I still haven’t found a way to eliminate the ego from the things that I’ve built.</p><figure name="9aa1" id="9aa1" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 220px; max-height: 192px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 87.3%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*WCcELwtNMfat6bvnbqs31Q.gif" data-width="220" data-height="192" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*WCcELwtNMfat6bvnbqs31Q.gif"></div></figure><p name="dfcb" id="dfcb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I think we have to stop thinking about the end goal. This is going to sound insufferably egotistical, but I think entrepreneurs will benefit from trying to be more like artists. We have to start building things because we want them to exist, not because we want to bump up our MRR. We have to start enjoying the process. We have to start loving building things again.</p><p name="b3d7" id="b3d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think a lot of us started this way, we had this vision for something and then we just spent time to learn it and to get it into the world. And maybe it didn’t get much attention or any attention, and it hurt, because we cared about a thing and it didn’t really feel good in the end.</p><p name="cf02" id="cf02" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">But that’s the inherent issue. Once the thing is finished and out there, we should be happy. We should be completely content because the thing exists. Not at it’s reception or the attention that it gets. But because it’s there, and we made it, and maybe it makes the world just a little better, or is funny, or it’s just beautiful.</p></div></div></section>

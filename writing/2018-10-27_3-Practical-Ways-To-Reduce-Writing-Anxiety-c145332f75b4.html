Sitting in front of your computer again. There’s this nagging anxiety that sits just below the surface. It might be so totally engrained that you don’t even really notice it. But your shoulders are scrunched up by your ears, and maybe you’re a little more irritated than normal. It’s probably the same anxiety that people get when they break their diet, or ‘forget’ to go to the gym. It’s a dull ache, not typically an acute pain. Oops, time to open Reddit. Wow. Front page stuff. Cool. Ahh let’s meander on over to Twitter. Bite sized, mmm.</p><p name="86c8" id="86c8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">How many writing sessions have you started this way? Me, personally? A lot. More than I can count. I’ve been there. You might even be there <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">right now.</em> And I know the next thing you’re gonna think is “Well, I’ll get started soon.” but that probably won’t happen. It kinda stings to think about it though right? That’s called cognitive dissonance.</p><blockquote name="ed9f" id="ed9f" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">cog·ni·tive dis·so·nance</strong></blockquote><blockquote name="2cf2" id="2cf2" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote"><em class="markup--em markup--blockquote-em">noun</em></blockquote><blockquote name="f850" id="f850" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--blockquote">The state of having inconsistent thoughts, beliefs, or attitudes, especially as relating to behavioral decisions and attitude change.</blockquote><p name="719c" id="719c" class="graf graf--p graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--blockquote">“I should be writing, but I’m not.” Why not? Because we have <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">anxiety </em>and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">fear </em>associated with some part of the writing process. That’s it. Maybe we ‘can’t think of anything to write’. Which is bullshit of course, because we have plenty to talk about. Maybe we think it’s not worth writing down. Maybe we’re worried people will hate it. Maybe our egos are too caught up in writing. It’s a part of who we are. Deeply personal.</p><p name="4603" id="4603" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Trust me, pal. People hating it is a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">good</em> outcome. People hating it requires people to have read it. The most likely outcome of anything you will ever write is nothing. Literally nothing. No one will read it. No one will like it. No one will hate it. It’ll just be you and your piece, staring each other down, eyeball to eyeball. Alone.</p><p name="01a8" id="01a8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s a good thing. It’s freeing. It means you can write anything. Funky pumpernickle alabaster. Bet those three words have never been written together.</p><h3 name="0f5b" id="0f5b" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">3 Practical Ways To Reduce Writing Anxiety</h3><h4 name="dfaa" id="dfaa" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--h3">1. Consistent starting.</h4><p name="1037" id="1037" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">You need to make this low stakes. Low fear, low anxiety means when it comes to the big leagues, it isn’t that scary anymore. Imagine a batter in baseball. Imagine if every game was his first time up to the plate: he’d strike out every time. The crowd roaring, the team relying on him to get that base hit. It would be nerve wracking. There’s absolutely no way he could perform to his potential. Now imagine if he had been to the plate ten thousand times before that. That’s a different story. You need to step up to the plate. You need to take the swing as often as you can. Which means committing to a schedule. Find out what works best for you. Maybe it’s once a week. Maybe it’s twice. Maybe it’s every day. All you need to do is commit to writing five, ten minutes. If you’re not feeling it, stop. Don’t push it. If you’re on a roll, see where it takes you.</p><h4 name="830e" id="830e" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">2. Perfection is your enemy</h4><p name="e36e" id="e36e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Now you take a step back and look at what you’ve written in ten minutes. For some of you I bet it’s the first thing you’ve written in weeks. Maybe months. I know what you’re thinking. But it’s not done. It’s not good. It’s this and it’s that and maybe if I took a few more minutes it could be the best thing ever written. Dude. No. Stop. There’s a time and a place for extensive editing. When people read your shit, then maybe think about editing a little bit more. For example, the two or three of you that are going to read this, don’t get me wrong I love the shit out of you. You’re awesome. You’re in it for the long haul. Mom, I bet you’re here. Love you, sorry I haven’t called. You’re all Team Jake, and I’m into that. But I’m not really gonna edit this for you. I have to work out and drive to work. Ain’t got time for that. What about if it goes viral? If it’s shit, and it goes viral, then is it shit? No. The purpose of this exercise isn’t to write extremely well. It’s to write consistently. It’s to publish consistently. It’s not to write the next great American novel. Perfection is your enemy. Avoid it at all costs.</p><h4 name="4e71" id="4e71" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">3. Publish Party</h4><p name="0895" id="0895" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">Now publish it. I don’t care if it’s not polished or if it’s not beautiful. You need to go through the whole process, to let your body get used to the idea that it isn’t painful to write. In fact for a lot of people it’s eventually pleasurable, because you finally beat back that anxiety that’s always in the back of your mind going ‘youshouldwritemoreyoushouldwritemore’.</p><p name="a9e1" id="a9e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">This is the final piece. Do it. You have to do it. Otherwise you’re going to constantly be in that state of slight anxiety. You’ll barely even know it. You’ll feel that low-level guilt of procrastination, when you can in fact feel that high of accomplishing a minor goal every day/week/whatever.</p></div></div></section>

For example, today I set a timer for 20 minutes. Within that 20 minutes I wanted to write my words for the day, and get on with it. Instead I looked through a book trying to find something to write about. We’re 10 minutes deep and I’ve got this paragraph you see here. Sick.</p><p name="d4a0" id="d4a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Maybe it’s because I was raised in a midwest, ‘mind-your-own-business’ sort of way, but I honestly don’t have that much to talk about. I know what I like. Scotch, web development, video games. And I know what I don’t like. Which really isn’t much.</p><p name="3b54" id="3b54" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I feel often enough that my opinion on something is effectively impotent. Regardless of how well my blog posts are (or are not) written, is it really going to be the piece of literature that inspires you to finally do the thing you’ve been putting off? Will it make you see the error of your ways?</p><p name="963c" id="963c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Likely not.</p><p name="f297" id="f297" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It would be nice, I suppose, if I had that transformative power. But no. I write these mostly for myself. Mostly because I sometimes commit to long bouts of writing, simply because I think something good does come out of it. Something ephemeral. I don’t expect some note from someone saying, “Wow this is really what did it for me.” It’s not something that has direct consequences on the world, I think.</p><p name="3687" id="3687" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Typically for me, though, I’m happy just knowing I did the thing I comitted to do. As much as I love you, it’s not for you.</p><p name="babc" id="babc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway, I figured in between random short fiction and weirdly technical posts about JSON Web Token, I’d review a twitter post. Maybe as sort of a response. I’m not much of a twitter guy, but there’s occasionally some really interesting stuff on there. Since this thread has a bunch of different awesome pieces (the whole thing is worth reading), I’m going to pick and choose them as I go. Here’s our first example:</p><figure name="c5fa" id="c5fa" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103670400417792"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="259f" id="259f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is one of those first big things that really clicked with me as an entrepreneur. It eventually proved itself to me when I had a small, but relatively successful patterned paint roller Etsy shop. I say relatively successful, meaning that it made a couple hundred dollars a month, and cost nothing to run. I just copy and pasted pictures from a Chinese catalog and then forwarded the Etsy shipping orders to them. I never pursued it, because I had just left for Southeast Asia, looking back, I should’ve pursued it more because of this. But it was my first taste of ‘making money while you slept’.</p><figure name="d331" id="d331" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103908947263488"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="ca04" id="ca04" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is something that I’ve been thinking about a lot as of late. You can find it popping up in a ton of my older posts. There is magic in volume. In iteration. If you have a 1% incremental gain on something every single day, at the end of the year you’ve improved 365%. There’s magic in large bodies of work, in a huge backlog of posts or artwork. Having done a massive amount of work <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">does something that isn’t exactly quantitative.</em> Sure, you can say “Well a massive amount of work makes you better.” Yes, this is true. But it seems to go beyond that. It explores different places, it makes 1 + 1 = 3, which is something magical and unexpected. Go do more of your work. Right now.</p><figure name="128f" id="128f" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002106317064949763"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="a36c" id="a36c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I think the huge part at the end of this was one of the massive reasons I learned to code in the first place. This no marginal cost of replication is insane if you think about it. Physical goods have these insane costs associated with them. You have to pay at the very least, for the materials used to create the goods. That doesn’t include the time it takes to make the goods, the people, the equipment, the storage of them. It’s bonkers. Code is small. Code can be infinitely replicated. You don’t have to pay it (ignoring server fees, I guess.), it never stops working. It doesn’t have opinions. It just does exactly what you tell it to do. And if what you’re telling it to do gives value to other people, well then you’re cooking with gas, son.</p><figure name="cb8f" id="cb8f" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002108800457883650"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="04a7" id="04a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">I think this has been my maddening downfall as an entrepreneur for the last 10 years. Yes, I’ve been doing this for 10 years. So if you’re just starting, boy let me tell you what. I still remember the time I told my ex girlfriend I wasn’t going to college, I was going to start a business. She asked if I was crazy. I responded I guess so. Go to college, kids.</p><p name="1066" id="1066" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve ignored the work. For so long. It’s insane to think about, but I think I’ve figured it out recently. In a lot of different areas of my life. Working out more, meditating, drinking less. It’s about the work. The discipline. Showing up every day. 1% incremental gains.</p><p name="d63a" id="d63a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I used to just obsess about the right thing to do, or even about being ‘too good’ for some work. Doing anything, even if it’s absolutely useless, is worth more than doing nothing. Action is the currency of advancement, not exactly correct or perfect action. Simply action. One thousand thoughts, rumination, planning, these are all just words for things that are not-action.</p><p name="c748" id="c748" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I like to think I’m done ignoring the work, but I’m sure I’ll fail in the future. The evil me will win out, I’ll drink a shitload of whiskey and pass out and I won’t publish my writing, or I won’t finish a project because I’m lazy and too content, or scared.</p><p name="f8e9" id="f8e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I can promise that I’ll always be fighting. Sometimes I’ll lose. But I’ll always come back swinging.</p><p name="ee55" id="ee55" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Yo if this interests you, if it’s cool, if it’s hip, it would really make me happy if you share it, clap for it, comment on it, whatever. A retweet goes a long way let me tell you what. Especially since I directly associate my self worth with the amount of views I get. Ha ha ha. Sigh.</strong></p><p name="6f3c" id="6f3c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Love you all</strong> ❤ <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Do something great.</strong></p></div></div></section>

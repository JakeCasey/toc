My projects. I want to make my pursuit of software development more creative. I have to admit this is in part spurned by <a href="https://twitter.com/internetvin" data-href="https://twitter.com/internetvin" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">InternetVin’s current project Code</a>, in which he creates something with code for 365 days.</p><p name="554b" id="554b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ve been helping him here and there with a few things, and it absolutely challenges how I think about development and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">what I actually know</em>. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">It also puts into contrast the types of projects I make and perhaps the types of projects I’m capable of making.</em></p><p name="08e8" id="08e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I think I’ve surrounded myself with too many business books, to be totally honest. Something in them was and is addicting, and I’ve spent countless hours reading and studying them. If you name one off the top of your head, I’ve likely digested it at least once. I love the feel of it, it’s that little drip of dopamine saying ‘I’m doing something for my business.’ I’m sick of it.</p><p name="2051" id="2051" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But for all the books I’ve read, I’ve yet to have a runaway hit of a product or project. Sure, I’ve made some money here and there, had some good feedback. I’ve learned so incredibly much. But nothing I could really hang my hat on. I think I can’t see the forest for the trees, as it were. I need to re-invigorate how I interact with the software that I write, and the creative processes that I follow.</p><p name="18f3" id="18f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Everything has been so serious. Everything carried so much weight. Every project, every piece of software I’ve wrote for myself had this ultimate resolution attached to it. It had to make money. It had to please people and fit their needs. It had to have a good user experience and a great design, so other people will like it, and give me money for it. It had to be this and it had to be that and I just don’t think that’s really how successful things are first built.</p><p name="01ad" id="01ad" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sure, I think successful things can be built this way. They are and have been for years. Some guy up top has a vision and some guy on the bottom puts in the work. It’s not some inspired creative exploit where the guy on the bottom is coming up with these intense artistic insights. Some manager argued with another manager until they agreed on a path, and then delegated it to someone.</p><p name="9d2a" id="9d2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’m not saying it isn’t possible. What I am saying is a lot of what I’ve tried so far hasn’t worked.</p><p name="b220" id="b220" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I have three projects. All things that I feel like come from me, more than the outside. If that makes sense.</p><p name="ac4e" id="ac4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/skeleton-key-a821930c464" data-href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/skeleton-key-a821930c464" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">One is Skeleton Key</a>. I believe software is going to be a massive part of my life for the foreseeable future. I love it. I love coding more than pretty much anything else. So I want to make it easier for myself in the future to build the stuff I want to build.</p><p name="951e" id="951e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two Operation: Green Thumb. Alright I have a confession. I’m obsessed with the idea of growing tomatoes indoors. I don’t know why. Maybe it’s that I hold the tomato as some type of base vegetable. If I can grow a tomato inside I can grow anything inside. This would be my journey to growing a full sized yielding tomato plant indoors. Full disclosure: I’ve never grown a tomato plant anywhere. This would include self watering, UV lamps, the works.</p><p name="4f71" id="4f71" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three, Lifeboat. This is something a little more esoteric. And also weird. I had the idea for this project in a dream. I’m not kidding, and I’m really not saying that just to sound mysterious or cool or whatever. I had the idea for this product in a dream. Let’s just call it a small, portable web server, with specific information on it. I’ll tell you more later, I promise.</p><p name="f2d2" id="f2d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Those are what I want to be working on. I don’t care if any of them make money. I don’t care if people like them or not. They’re for me. I think that’s enough to make them great.</p><p name="623a" id="623a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Yo if this interests you, if it’s cool, if it’s hip, it would really make me happy if you share it, clap for it, comment on it, whatever. A retweet goes a long way let me tell you what. Especially since I directly associate my self worth with the amount of views I get. Ha ha ha. Sigh.</strong></p><p name="cae1" id="cae1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Love you all</strong> ❤ <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Do something great.</strong></p></div></div></section>

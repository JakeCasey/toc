It’s an age old question. I can see it burning in your eyes. It’s a firey ember hiding just below the surface. How <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">do </strong>potatoes work? Where were potatoes invented? Can Matt Damon actually grow potatoes on Mars? Was the Irish Potato Famine just an elaborate conspiracy to keep the Irish people down? Potato questions abound. Potatoes. Potatoes. God that’s a funny sounding word. Poe-tay-toes.</p><p name="5d8b" id="5d8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">You’re probably thinking to yourself, “Wow, Jake has actually finally gone off his rocker. He’s lost to us now. First he’s writing <a href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/1-mindset-change-that-will-transform-how-you-travel-for-cheap-602f9727a060" data-href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/1-mindset-change-that-will-transform-how-you-travel-for-cheap-602f9727a060" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">about travel</a>, and then <a href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/this-is-how-i-almost-built-an-illegal-startup-7185dae4a4aa" data-href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/this-is-how-i-almost-built-an-illegal-startup-7185dae4a4aa" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">about illegal Startups</a> (that have since been put on the back burner), and now about potatoes?” You’d be partially right.</p><p name="8d7d" id="8d7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Really, I’ve decided that instead of spending so much time brooding about what to write, and being like “Nah, that’s not interesting.” or “Who wants to read about that? No one that’s who.” and pre-emptively beating my unborn writing senseless, I’d just write something. Anything. Maybe even about potatoes. Maybe it’ll suck. Maybe it won’t. It’s better than doing nothing.</p><p name="f4f5" id="f4f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If I can make a topic like potatoes interesting to write or read, that means I’ll never have any excuses about what or what not to write. I can write about potatoes. There’s some other reasons too, but I know what you’re really here for. Potato facts.</p><p name="18fa" id="18fa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">However, if you’re actually not here for the potato facts, I wouldn’t feel bad if you skipped to the bottom. But it turns out potatoes are kind of cool if you’re into pieces of information that will probably never be useful in your life.</p><figure name="966a" id="966a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 450px; max-height: 450px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*HhWgDm1QaG7NMzhXuxmy5w.gif" data-width="450" data-height="450" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*HhWgDm1QaG7NMzhXuxmy5w.gif"></div></figure><h3 name="c768" id="c768" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">What’s The Story Morning Glory?</h3><p name="057d" id="057d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Names are important. Starting with the name seems like the most logical place to begin. The original potato was in fact of the sweet variety (more on this later), and called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">patata </em>by the Spanish. This is a hybridization of the <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Taíno </strong>and <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Quechuan </strong>words <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">batata </em>and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">papa</em>, respectively.</p><p name="344c" id="344c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">At one point Taíno was the primary language spoken in the Caribbean, while Quechuan is from the Andes: The Birthplace of the Potato. While Taíno is largely extinct at this point, Quechuan is a thriving language, with some seven million speakers remaining in Peru.</p><p name="5f3a" id="5f3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Peru in fact houses the earliest known archaeological remains of potato tubers, at Ancón, dating to 2500BC. It’s in South America that potatoes were first domesticated and cultivated.</p><figure name="cf09" id="cf09" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 700px; max-height: 700px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 100%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*0USK3SCY6yxB3wHC5ZIZ1g.png" data-width="2258" data-height="2258" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0USK3SCY6yxB3wHC5ZIZ1g.png"></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">I used photoshop to make this can you tell?</figcaption></figure><p name="5f4e" id="5f4e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">Potatoes were one of the primary foodstuffs of the Incan Empire, who powered their armies via a dish called chuño or papas secas, a specialized process of freeze-drying potatoes. Potatoes selected for chuño are laid out in an even layer on the ground, and subjected to the cold temperatures in the mountains, and allowed to dry during the daytime sun. The potatoes are then transported to another flat area, and stomped or danced on by whole families, thereby squeezing the rest of the water from the potato’s flesh. What results is a freeze-dried — and shelf-stable — potato that can potentially last decades.</p><p name="669c" id="669c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But I digress, chuño isn’t even the most interesting part about potatoes! Spanish sailors, after exploring and mining in South America presumably returned to Spain with potatoes and maize in the bellies of their ships, thus introducing potatoes to Europe and placing the potato in a position to become today’s fourth largest food crop.</p><p name="a6a1" id="a6a1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But it wasn’t that easy. Potatoes were largely spread for reasons not entirely related to food. It was suspected that the tuber held medicinal properties. Shakespeare thought it was an aphrodesiac. These beliefs caused Philip II of Spain to send a few potatoes to the Pope. Yep. A gift of potatoes. The Pope then sent the tubers to his papal ambassador in the Netherlands, who then planted them willy nilly around Europe.</p><p name="08aa" id="08aa" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Spain was also one of the first countries in Europe to also embrace potatoes as a way of fueling their armies protecting their empire. Peasants, being introduced to potatoes via the traveling Spanish armies, were untrusting of potatoes, which were then typically grown with other herbs and medicines as opposed to in the fields where traditional grains were cultivated. They nicknamed potatoes “The Devil’s Apples”.</p><p name="fb67" id="fb67" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Skipping some of the less interesting bits, here’s the highlights:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="750b" id="750b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Marie Antoinette once wore a headdress of potato flowers to a ball.</li><li name="c112" id="c112" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fredrick The Great attempted to quell the peasant’s distaste for potatoes, proclaiming in his ‘Potato Order’ that the tubers were “a very nutritious food supplement.”. He is affectionately known as the <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">Kartoffelkönig</em> (“potato king”).</li><li name="04a5" id="04a5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The Irish Potato Famine (not a conspiracy) caused around one million Irish to emigrate. Ireland’s population declined by nearly 25% due to death and this emigration. That’s nuts.</li></ul><figure name="6217" id="6217" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--li"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 400px; max-height: 300px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*eWkg2IfmfIP5InrUkmVvuw.gif" data-width="400" data-height="300" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*eWkg2IfmfIP5InrUkmVvuw.gif"></div></figure><h3 name="07fb" id="07fb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Taxonomy And You</h3><p name="907a" id="907a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Solanum Tuberosum</em></strong></p><p name="51cd" id="51cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are about 5,000 varieties of potato world wide. This 5,000 does not include the sweet potato. That’s right. Our orange friend isn’t actually part of the same family as our white-fleshed savory potato pals. Without getting into some sciency-stuff — though don’t get me wrong I love me some sciency stuff — there was just a cool little connection between the two family names. Despite being both called potatoes, the white-fleshed potato that most of us associate with ‘potato’ is called <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Solanum Tuberosum </em>and is part of the Nightshade family. The Nightshades include various agricultural and medicinal plants, including the tomato, and the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Capsicum</em> family! Peppers! Why is this important? I use important very loosely here.</p><p name="2f2d" id="2f2d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well, the sweet potato belongs to the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Convolvulaceae </em>family. Otherwise known as the Morning Glory family. I find it endlessly entertaining that the sweet ‘potato’ and potato are also Morning Glory and Nightshade.</p><figure name="6126" id="6126" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 500px; max-height: 257px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 51.4%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*VfgonZm2k2qnzNangWki-g.gif" data-width="500" data-height="257" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*VfgonZm2k2qnzNangWki-g.gif"></div></figure><h3 name="db45" id="db45" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">The Silent Killer</h3><p name="9575" id="9575" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">They’re lurking in the dark corners of your kitchen. You know the ones I’m talking about. The places where you put them after accidentally buying too many for that one recipe you found. You actually bring them <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">into your own home. </strong>That’s right. They’re sitting there, biding their time. Growing more deadly by the minute. Waiting for their moment to strike.</p><p name="8392" id="8392" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yes, it’s potatoes.</p><p name="63bc" id="63bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">No, for real that’s actually what’s happening.</p><p name="604b" id="604b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I’ll be honest. I’ve almost commited suicide by potato. You probably have, too. Let me explain:</p><p name="96cb" id="96cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Alongside <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Solanum Tuberosum </em>in the Nightshade family is none other than belladonna, henbane, and tobacco. The foliage and berries of these plants tend to be extremely toxic to the human body. And so are potatoes. Sometimes. Specifically the green plant parts and flowers of potatoes are in fact toxic to humans.</p><p name="3c62" id="3c62" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Potatoes (among other members of the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Solanaceae</em>) contain glycoalkaloids, like solanine. Solanine acts as a natural pesticide, deterring prey that would like to munch on some potato leaves. In humans symptoms of solanine poisoning include:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="f2c4" id="f2c4" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Vomiting</li><li name="af93" id="af93" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Fever or lower than normal body temperature (hypothermia)</li><li name="6418" id="6418" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Headache</li><li name="33e5" id="33e5" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Slow pulse and/or breathing</li><li name="7862" id="7862" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Stomach Pain</li><li name="0a23" id="0a23" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Diarrhea</li><li name="6b28" id="6b28" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Hallucinations</li><li name="3314" id="3314" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Delirium</li><li name="5cab" id="5cab" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Shock</li><li name="e16b" id="e16b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Vision Changes</li></ul><p name="faea" id="faea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Now, before you never eat another potato, let me tell you how this works. I’m certain you’ve left a potato alone for a little too long. It starts to grow and change and mutate. Looks like something from the Alien series, right? Eventually it starts to grow sprouts. Now, the most important part, is the coloration. Basically all parts of the potato plant that are green have a higher concentration of solanine, and thus are unsafe for humans to eat. It’s the potato’s hulk mode.</p><h3 name="6636" id="6636" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">TL DR: Potatoes are cool, don’t eat green ones.</h3><figure name="5fd0" id="5fd0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--h3"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked" style="max-width: 320px; max-height: 240px;"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill" style="padding-bottom: 75%;"></div><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*gBBwgJXbnuHVp_UcGQeC7A.gif" data-width="320" data-height="240" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*gBBwgJXbnuHVp_UcGQeC7A.gif"></div></figure><h3 name="36a7" id="36a7" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Why have I done this?</h3><p name="465e" id="465e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">There’s a few reasons, really:</p><p name="528e" id="528e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">One, I’ve been listening to a podcast called <a href="http://qi.com/podcast/" data-href="http://qi.com/podcast/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">No Such Thing as A Fish</a> — in short it’s just four people sharing facts. Note that I don’t preclude ‘facts’ with ‘interesting’. Some of them are definitely interesting, some are coincidental, some are downright false. It takes normal things, and has the capability of making them fun or interesting. It embodies curiosity, and I love that about it. I listen to it every night while I go to sleep. In the podcast they often do pretty incredible amounts of research into a wide variety of things that you would just never encounter in your day-to-day life. They’re searching for information, not to obtain an actionable or tangible nugget of info, but because the act of learning something you didn’t know before is enjoyable.</p><p name="5c6d" id="5c6d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Which it is. Incredibly. I had a lot of fun writing this, even though it’s literally just No Such Thing As a Sweet Potato.</p><p name="0466" id="0466" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Two, I’ve been struggling with content creation for a long time. I used to love writing. It was an impulse, an itch that needed scratching. Then I did it for a living. That sucked every ounce of joy and wonder out of writing for me. Part of this is me searching for that spark again.</p><p name="c0c6" id="c0c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And if I don’t find the spark then at least I’ll have found the ability to force myself to do things I don’t really want to do all the time. Which is a useful skill in itself.</p><p name="0e39" id="0e39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Three, I also wanted to write something that had a high probability of being bad (potato facts, for real?), because you learn more from shitty things than you do things that everyone likes.</p><p name="52de" id="52de" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Fourth and final, I hope that just one of you would read this and take only one thing from it. Anything is interesting. Everything is interesting. The floor you’re standing on, the air you’re breathing, the phone you’re holding or the last meal you had. It has a history, it has coincidences and setbacks and trials. No matter what ‘it’ is. There’s more to it. Even if you dig just below the surface.</p><p name="b1ea" id="b1ea" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">If you’re bored, if you don’t find something interesting, you’re not looking hard enough. There’s beauty in everything. Even potatoes. Hopefully, I can share some of that beauty with you.</p><p name="2503" id="2503" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">P.S. Hey, you’ve made it this far, that means you must really like me. I really like you. Let’s be friends? If you can hit the little clap button that thing literally injects dopamine straight into my system, so that’s cool. And shares on Facebook and other social media directly validate my actions, and we all know how most of us get our validation from social media. So if you could do that that’d be cool. If not I’ll just wallow in self-pity and think I suck at life. Guilt missile guilt missle. Pew pew.</p><p name="f8a3" id="f8a3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">P.P.S Thank you for reading. It means a lot to me. Time is the most valuable resource we have, so to spend a little bit of it on my stuff is the greatest thing you can do. Thanks.</p></div></div></section>

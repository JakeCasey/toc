It dragged uselessly behind him, leaving a small trail in the dirt. His leather shoes were cracked and the shoelaces hung loose on one side. The tongue of his boot hung open wide.</p><p name="dd92" id="dd92" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Under his arm he carried worn cardboard box. It was the same color as his skin. Dark brown, cracked, and weathered. He tottered, tilting his whole body to pull his leg with him. In his other arm he carried a long pole. Only held together with duct tape, it bent and swayed as he walked, threatening to be unwieldly. She could see a four day stubble on the man’s chin. Patchy, and flecked with white. He was sweating, and his face contorted in pain with every stride.</p><p name="3209" id="3209" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He approached the board. It loomed above the square — at least what was called the square. It was really just a gathering of old park benches. The board had previously been a billboard. She could see the remains of old advertisements, peeling at the edges and curling inwards, browning in the rain and sun. One read, “We used to have trouble with slow drains,” but was cut off mid-sentence, by a large tear that ran across the board. Wooden slats were nailed to the board, and ran parallel with the bottom edge, one every foot or so, until the top. Thirty-five, in total.</p><p name="b08b" id="b08b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The man finished his approach, and dropped the box in front of the board, it’s contents leaping into the air as he did so. Letters. Numbers. Stacks and stacks of rectangular plastic cards. The kinds you’d see on old signs in towns that didn’t exist anymore. They used to be arranged to say “Grandma’s Best Pie” or “Oil Change $19.99” or “Used Cars, Good Prices”. Now their purpose was different.</p><p name="1942" id="1942" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He reached into his pocket, filtering through the objects he found there. He extricated a handkerchief from the pile, and daubed at his forehead, blew his nose, and returned it to his back pocket. After returning a few other small items, he smoothed out a tiny crumpled piece of paper. She could hear his hacking cough from her spot on one of the park benches.</p><p name="3527" id="3527" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She drew her attention from the board and the man to glance around the park. Most of the benches were full. In fact there were quite a few people in the square today. Nearly all of them, besides those just passing through stopping for the man’s spectacle, wore torn and battered running shoes. Light jackets. Their hair was cropped or tied close. Several of the men were shaved bald. They moved surely. They were better fed than most, but remained thin. Some of the men rocked their ankles in circles, or stretched their legs, propping their feet against the benches and leaning across them. Some wore small bags slung across their backs, tightly wrapped against their bodies. All of their clothing was tight fitting. Some wore jeans that bore long cuts or holes, but nearly all were patched. She couldn’t say the same for the others in the square.</p><p name="0169" id="0169" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She turned to look back at the board. The man had begun sliding the plastic letters into place, slipping them into their rows in the wooden slats.</p><p name="744a" id="744a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sliding them in from the right, he started with a number. A rank. This row’s was “35”. Though the man was slow, next came a name, it read “Ryan Kobeleski”. She glanced back at the crowd. Ryan wasn’t in attendance. He finished the line with a number. Zero. Goose egg. Nada. This was the monetary value of the items that Ryan had ran this week. Ryan hadn’t ran in seven days. He was out on medical, said his foot was bothering him. Sometimes runners were truly hurt. Other times they needed a break from out there. Most people didn’t fault them for it.</p><p name="e3a0" id="e3a0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The old man continued up the board in this manner. 34, 33, 32. There were occasional scoffs and jeers at the old man. Runners disagreeing with their rankings or the value of the items they delivered. Items for delivery were often packaged heavily. Runners had no idea what they were carrying. There were rules of course, items couldn’t be over a certain weight, or couldn’t be imbalanced. But for the most part runners were told to just run.</p><p name="1cd4" id="1cd4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As the rankings began filling to the top, the crowd grew pensive. The names and numbers had begun to reach the highest rows of the billboard, and thus the man had to reach with the long grappling pole, and push the letters across. It was painfully slow. Perhaps the township chose him for their board because of it. Just to torture the runners further.</p><p name="5768" id="5768" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He slid a large plastic “2” in the row second from the top. She felt her jaw clench. He drew a letter from the box and attached it to the pole, but his body was blocking the crowd’s view for the length of the movement.</p><p name="984a" id="984a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As he detached, he revealed the letter ‘G’. Several men whooped, and hollered. She could see across the park a few men slapping their friend on the back good in congratulations. He rocked forward under their pressure, but his eyes were also across the park on her. He tipped an imaginary hat towards her.</p><p name="a5ec" id="a5ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">She closed her eyes and shook her head, staring back at the board. She noticed her arms were crossed tightly across her chest, and relaxed them down to her sides, feigning nonchalance.</p><p name="cdc3" id="cdc3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Gavin was ranked number two, and had ran over a thousand dollars worth of goods this week. She didn’t know how many runs he had gone on exactly, but it was certainly an excellent number. Other runners rarely broke eight hundred or so.</p><p name="ca3a" id="ca3a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The old man slid the number one into it’s place at the top of the board. Followed soon after by the letter “C”. Some of the crowd jeered once again, but there were also a few claps, and shouts of encouragement. He methodically pushed the letters across the board until the name read “Calli”. No last name. Just Calli. She saw the old man check the paper once again, smoothing it out with his cracked and worn hands. He drew it close to his face, and then shrugged, resigned. He slid the number three, with three zeroes behind it next to the name. Three thousand dollars. The crowd was silent.</p><p name="d908" id="d908" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">It was her own name spelled across the top of the board. Calli stood, as the old man packed his extra plastic cards into his box. His job was finished. Her’s was just beginning. She then walked from the square, heading north. Her next run would be soon. She had to prepare.</p></div></div></section>

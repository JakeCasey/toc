      <h2>Day # 1</h2>

      <p>
        Welcome to day #1 again. A day much like any other day. Except I've
        gotten up early, which means I have time to write. I guess these 350
        words are to see if I can still do it. Still got the chops. Can still
        dredge up some type of written word and put it to page.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also just wanted some time before going to work. I'm terribly
        unproductive in the evening. I watch a lot of Twitch or play a lot of
        video games. Which because it isn't 'TV', I feel good about. I want to
        start waking up early and writing and reading and working on personal
        stuff.
      </p>

        There's been this little disconnect with my work and my personal work.
        Where I've been conflating the two, or working on the two at the same
        time. And I don't really know if I like that. Part of me says it's nice
        because I have the extra time to do it, but on the other hand it
        suddenly feels like it's not for me anymore, it's for them. Which is
        kind of for 'us' in the end of it. But at the same time I just suddenly
        feel like it's no longer mine.

      <p>Goddamn, this coffee tastes good.</p>

        I think it would be great to crush out a few books before the end of the
        year. I still have to find a good way of retaining book knowledge. Maybe
        I'll bring out Heylights again? Yikes! I just got distracted by Twitter
        of course! I wish I had something more important to say here. I wonder
        if it's because I think that writing should be good or should have a
        purpose that I don't write more often? Perhaps I've come to the opinion
        that writing is for a reason and writing for no reason is bad! You MUST
        have VALUE to give. Well fuck you, what if my value is unknown to even
        me. What a great sentence. My Value is Unknown to Even Me.

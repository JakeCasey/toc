Failed implies an ending. I haven’t given up. And that’s not even really a good way to think about it. It’s just kind of who I am, so I’d probably do this sort of stuff regardless of whether or not I made money doing it. At this point, I’ve done everything. I’ve owned a cleaning business, I’ve dropshipped products online. I’ve written software-as-a-service. Right now I’m a bartender and Wordpress developer. I’ve also written things. Nothing you’ve heard of, but I’d have to say my career as a writer was probably my most successful venture, financially at least.</p><p name="77cf" id="77cf" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s one of the only projects that I really pushed <a href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/the-grand-unfinished-theory-of-detachment-pt-8-e43ee6714024" data-href="https://medium.com/@jakecasey/the-grand-unfinished-theory-of-detachment-pt-8-e43ee6714024" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" target="_blank">the concept of Volume.</a> It’s very likely where I learned about it. Where I really internalized the concept that the volume of creative work you do is nearly as important — if not more important — than the quality of the work you do. As a budding writer, it was a bit disconcerting. If I wrote more than writers that were better than me, I would make more money. It had a compounding effect. It would build upon itself and every time something got some attention, that attention would trickle back down your backlog. And if your backlog was big enough, that trickle would turn into a landslide. Eventually every time you released something you’d have outstanding success, because everything fed everything else, like tributaries to a great river of sales and attention. The mailing list fed the new release, the new release fed the backlog, the backlog fed the mailing list. It was insane. And then I had an idea.</p><h4 name="d0dd" id="d0dd" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Applying this model to software development</h4><p name="0b3d" id="0b3d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">How does this fit with my current projects and ideas? This all ties back to the Volume thing. I’ve been spending entirely too much time on every product I’ve built. I have a fear of releasing and getting that real feedback that’s required for a product to succeed. There’s a hundred reasons I don’t launch every time. Guardian, where I learned the basics of MERN Development, along with React-Native. Why in the world did I think I could build that? It’s crazy to think that somebody with no formal training (or even a job in development at the time!) could build a full-stack web application with companion React-Native. ← Ego.</p><p name="31e3" id="31e3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It was hard. It eventually mostly worked. I probably spent a year on it which is crazy to think about. I never ended up releasing it. I was scared it wouldn’t work. It’s the same perfectionism I used to have with writing. Which I got rid of long ago, and was better off for it.</p><p name="a3bd" id="a3bd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So now we’re doing things a little differently:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="9828" id="9828" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">I will only work on things so long as they continue to excite me.</li><li name="d4d0" id="d4d0" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">I will not work on something more than three (3) weeks without some type of outside validation/confirmation that the idea is worth pursuing. For example, users and attention.</li><li name="7925" id="7925" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">No longer shooting for quality (counterintuitive, I know) but for Volume.</li></ol><p name="06db" id="06db" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Now you’re saying to yourself, this is just ‘building an MVP’. Of course. Of course it is. But if you’ve built things yourself, a little piece of you gets put into anything you build. And having somebody reject that thing you build is scary, and hurts. So we either don’t build out of fear, or we don’t release it to other people, also out of fear.</p><p name="519f" id="519f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This ego is stupid. It’s standing between you and me and so much success. Financially, socially, whatever. This fear is the root of all of these problems.</p><p name="168c" id="168c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I want to do the same thing I did with writing: Just write. Don’t think about the consequences, don’t think about the results. Just build things. Ask people to pay for them. If they don’t, it’s cool, you only spent a week on it anyway. The more time you spend on something the more you emotionally ‘need’ it to work. Otherwise all that time you spent is for nothing.</p><p name="8195" id="8195" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The first few products took me a while because I was learning, and because I was scared. If it takes you three hours to get REST set up, you’re not releasing in a week, that’s for sure. But I’m a little better than I was then. So I think now it’s time to get to work again.</p><p name="def9" id="def9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Love you, bye.</p></div></div></section>
